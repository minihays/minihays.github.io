<h2>The Beacon Book Club Books</h2>

*This group started in 2025 with members from a local Pride group we started called ["The Beacon"](https://www.instagram.com/thebeacontonka/). I can't wait to see how this group grows and evolves over time!* <br />
<br />
**Disclaimer**: All book links go to [Bookshop.org](https://bookshop.org/) so you can help support the Independent bookstore of your choice. My pick is [The Thinking Spot](https://www.thethinkingspot.us/) which is a local STEM bookstore. 🤩📚👩‍🔬🛍️
