I mentioned briefly about how we came to start our journey on the lake. The process of buying a lot, tearing a house down and building a new one has been quite the experience. And we aren't finished yet! Here is what the house looked like when we started.

After we purchased the property, we spent some time hanging out there. We would get dinner and eat at the house and it was a nice destination when there was a house and running water there to use the bathroom. After the water was shut off, that was a different experience. Our trips out there were much shorted until they tear-down process began.

The house would have been ok to renovate had we wanted to use it for a cabin. But it was in really rough shape. It had been added on to in many places, various times and in very, shall we say, unique ways. By the time we would have renovated it to suit us and get everything up to code and in good condition, it just made more sense to tear it down. 

We had heard that sometimes the fire department would be willing to burn the property down and use it for training purposes. We had them come out and take a look, but ultimately, we didn't have the right set up to make it work. The plan was to have it torn down. First we needed to get a tree company in to remove some trees we knew would be in the way of the new house plan. It turned out that a few others were unhealthy as well, so those were also taken down. They also trimmed up our huge oak tree on the lake side of the house. 

We ended up using a company that did both the tear down and excavating for the new house. It was a huge project to tear down the house and it was so fun to watch. When I thought about the size of the house, I didn't realize how much work and how long it would take to get the house taken down and then take out all of its "guts". We did install a camera to take time lapse videos and that has been quite exciting to look back at how far we have come.
