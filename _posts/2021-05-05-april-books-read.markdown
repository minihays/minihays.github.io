Here are all the books I read/listened to in April. This was a record month for me with 19 books! 

With all these books I have been reading, I surpassed my reading goal for 2021 before this month was over. So I upped my reading goal for the year from 60 to 100. There is a chance I will need to increase it again, but I'll cross that bridge when I get to it.

This month I [quit rating my books](https://andihays.dev/books/2021/04/28/book-ratings.html). I liked most of the books this month, but if you want full reviews, check out my [bookstagram page - @minihaysreads](http://instagram.com/minihaysreads). 

Here is a link for each of the books. I am going to skip the summary this month since there are so many. :)
