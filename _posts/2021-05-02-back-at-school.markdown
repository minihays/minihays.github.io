The kids have been back at school for about a month now. And they are loving it!

It felt like such a heavy decision when we were trying to decide if we were going to send the kids back to school. Distance learning was going well, COVID wasn't close to over, but we knew that being at a new school after moving it was important for them to make some friends in-person.

After we all got COVID, sending them back to school was the easy decision. We weren't avoiding the big risk of getting it at school any more. And while the kids were a little hesitant at first, they all have loved being back at school and are all doing so well.

Masks are just a moot point. If you don't want your kids wearing masks, I say it isn't ideal, but isn't it better than not being at school? The kids hardly notice. They get home and sometimes need to be reminded to take them off. They never complain about them and just know it is part of life (for now or forever).

The bus has been going well, too. They get picked up and dropped off right in front of the house. They say they have a lot of fun and I know that Alex has really liked having his sisters with him on the bus.

Their teachers have been wonderful and I feel like the kids have just meshed right into class with ease. The teachers definitely need to be commended for all the changes that have been thrown at them this year with kids coming and going and needing to do so much adjusting on the fly. I have been so happy with our experience at our new school for both distnace learning and in-person.

Overall, I am so happy that they are going to get these 9 weeks back in-person. They have made so many new friends and are really thriving at school. I am so proud of these kids and how resilient they have been to the changes.
