This is my most favorite song right now. I have it set as my ring tone for 6:59pm every day which is the time my dad died. 

I am including the lyrics below. It's been two months today since my dad died and I have just recently been able to sing this song maybe once without crying. It is just beautiful and hits so close to home. I wanted to read parts of it or play the song at his funeral, but I wasn't sure I'd be able to hold myself together.

I emphasized the lyrics that I really connect with and make me cry. Even reading them as I write this make me tear up. Grief is hard. Grief is unique to each person and circumstance. My heart goes out to you if this song touched you as it has touched me while I maneuver this new life without my dad in it.

<b>YOU KNOW THAT I DON’T LIKE TO SAY GOODBYE<br />
I DIDN’T KNOW THAT WE WERE OUT OF TIME<br />
I’M SORRY THAT I COULDN’T SAVE YOUR LIFE</b><br />
SO, I WALK<br />
YEAH, I WALK<br />

<b>I GO TO PICK THE PHONE UP EVERY DAY<br />
AND IMAGINE CONVERSATIONS WE WOULD SAY<br />
BUT, I’M ALWAYS HANGIN’ UP THE SAME WAY</b><br />
AND, I WALK<br />
YEAH, I WALK<br />

IN THE HOUSE WHERE THE HEART DON’T CRY<br />
DANCING IN A SILVER LIGHT<br />
AND I’M DREAMING OF YOU TONIGHT<br />
I MISS YOU ALL THE TIME<br />
ALL THE STARS ARE CALLING OUT YOUR NAME<br />
EVER SINCE YOU WENT AWAY<br />
THERE’S NO SLEEPING YOU OFF MY MIND<br />
I MISS YOU ALL THE TIME<br />
OH<br />

MISS YOU ALL THE TIME<br />

<b>I KNOW THAT YOU WERE ONLY PASSING THROUGH<br />
IN A MOMENT YOU WERE LIGHTING UP THE ROOM<br />
OH, THEY’LL NEVER BE ANOTHER LIKE YOU</b><br />
SO, I WALK<br />
AND, I WALK<br />

AND I TRY TO KEEP MY EYES UPON THE ROAD<br />
AND REMEMBER ALL THE STORIES THAT YOU TOLD<br />
<b>OH, I’M SORRY THAT YOU’LL NEVER GROW OLD</b><br />
SO, I WALK<br />
YEAH, I WALK<br />

IN THE HOUSE WHERE THE HEART DON’T CRY<br />
DANCING IN A SILVER LIGHT<br />
AND I’M DREAMING OF YOU TONIGHT<br />
I MISS YOU ALL THE TIME<br />
ALL THE STARS ARE CALLING OUT YOUR NAME<br />
EVER SINCE YOU WENT AWAY<br />
THERE’S NO SLEEPING YOU OFF MY MIND<br />
I MISS YOU ALL THE TIME<br />
YEAH<br />

MISS YOU ALL THE TIME<br />

I MISS YOU<br />
I MISS YOU<br />
I MISS YOU ALL THE TIME<br />

IN THE HOUSE WHERE THE HEART DON’T CRY<br />
DANCING IN A SILVER LIGHT<br />
AND I’M DREAMING OF YOU TONIGHT<br />
OH, I MISS YOU ALL THE TIME<br />
ALL THE STARS ARE CALLING OUT YOUR NAME<br />
EVER SINCE YOU WENT AWAY<br />
THERE’S NO DREAMING YOU OFF MY MIND<br />
I MISS YOU ALL THE TIME<br />
OH, I MISS YOU ALL THE TIME<br />
YEAH, I MISS YOU ALL THE TIME.<br />
