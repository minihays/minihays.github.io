Here are the 10 books I read in May. A few notes on the books this month:

I've seen **The Last Animal** and **Icebreaker** all over. They were both ok. Didn't love them as much as it seems everyone else has. I enjoyed **Expiration Dates**. I loved Serle's other book **In Five Years**, so I was glad it had her same lovely touch to this one. **Wrong Place, Wrong Time** and **First Lie Wins** were not favorites. Didn't love either of them and was hoping for better twisty endings. **#murdertrending** I read with my oldest. It was a little gory at first and then by the end it was just kind of silly. **The Paradise Problem** I loved and was hilarious and so cute. **Whatshisface** was dumb, but I read it because my middle asked me to. She agreed it was kind of dumb. LOVED **Watering The Soul** and can't wait to read more of her poetry books. **Home Is Where The Bodies Are** was a book a friend and I both bought when we were out shopping. It has the most unique cover (that looks like a VHS tape and a sleeve for it, too!) It was slightly predictable, but fun to read with a friend.

Here are the books I read this month. Check out my [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/48253141) page for ⭐️ ratings of these books. I hope you find something that looks interesting to you.
