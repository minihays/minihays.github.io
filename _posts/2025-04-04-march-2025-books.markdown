I hope you find something that looks interesting to you. Below are a few notes on the books this month.

**Total books for the year: 45**

1. 🎧 **The Gifts Of Imperfection** by *Brene Brown* - I wanted to love this. It was short, read by the author (whom I have enjoyed other books) and had good content. But I just felt so bored. I think if you wanted something specific, the ten topics could be a guide for something specific. But all of it together just didn’t do it for me. Maybe I am just in a better place mentally and it wasn’t something I needed at this time because I know it is a very well-loved book.
2. 📱 **A Bit Much** by *Lyndsay Rush* - Love Love Love! I love a good poetry book and this was definitely one of my favorites. I highlighted so many full poems, parts of poems and sent snippets to friends. I didn’t know much about Rush before this book, but I will be following her more: [@maryoliversdrunkcousin](https://www.instagram.com/maryoliversdrunkcousin/). Very funny. Very honest. Very relatable. All the stars. ⭐️
3. 🎧📱 **Fourteen Days** by *Margaret Atwood & Others* - I was so so excited about this. But if you are going to read it….you can basically skip to the last chapter. Or maybe even the last half of the last chapter. I am glad I didn’t quit because I love a COVID book. This was a collaboration of many authors. So each character/story is very unique and almost feel not very cohesive because of the varying writers. But the ending was SO good! 
4. 🎧 **Insomnia** by *Sarah Pinborough* - When I found this book by the author of “Behind Her Eyes” I couldn’t check this one out fast enough! This one was a bit confusing at times and even after reading up about it online, I don’t think anyone has an exact answer for this book. The epilogue briefly connects “Insomnia” and “Behind Her Eyes”, but it’s not a sequel or anything. I read them so far apart, that I never would have caught this if I didn’t read it online. I feel like if you just go into it and read it outright, you’ll probably enjoy it. If you try picking it to pieces, you may get frustrated at the details. 
5. 🎧 **Sunderworld, Vol. 1: The Extraordinary Disappointments of Leopold Berry** by *Ransom Riggs* - This cover was so fun, looking like an 80s VHS throwback. And I read all of Rigg’s Miss Peregrine books. But this one I could not stay interested in. I actually stopped it and was going to DNF it, but decided to finish it. But I will say that I can’t really tell you any major details because I was so distracted while listening. Just didn’t hold my interest and I sadly won’t be reading the others in this series when they come out…..even if the covers are gorgeous. 
6. 🎧📱📖 **Louder Than Hunger** by *John Schu* - Absolutely fabulous from the cover, to the prose inside, to the very last page. This book focuses on a teen boy with an eating disorder who goes into medical care for help. It is heartbreaking, hopeful, sad, touching, beautiful and a MUST READ! 
7. 📱 **The Fall Risk** by *Abby Jimenez* - Absolutely loved this little short story. I thought it was such a fun and unique setting. I adored the characters and I like that the FMC was able to feel support, but also save herself. Love a strong FMC.
8. 🎧 **When The World Tips Over** by *Jandy Nelson* - Fabulous! This was kind of long and had a slight magical aspect, but this YA book was so well done. I just loved how the characters were connected and how everything wove together so nicely. The different perspectives were so good and you really felt for each of the characters. And let’s not forget about the cover that has been drawing me to this book for a long time!!
9. 🎧 **Deep End** by *Ali Hazelwood* - I have loved all of Ali’s books, mostly because she has FMC in STEM fields. This book has gotten some backlash because people didn’t like the premise of the relationship. But my biggest gripe, is I wish there had been more about her medical research and education and a bit less about the swimming aspect. I felt like there could have been more about the FMC and MMC working together on their research and how she kind of schools him in a few areas. But overall, I enjoyed it. I also loved the cover with the matte photo and shiny water drops!
10. 🎧 **My Sister, the Serial Killer** by *Oyinkan Braithwaite* - This one was interesting and a bit twisted. It was quite short, but packed a bunch inside it. A fun debut. 
11. 🎧📱 **We All Live Here** by *Jojo Moyes* - Stunning cover art. So so story. I think I might appreciate this one more if I were reading it with someone to discuss while reading. I think it had a lot of complexities that could make it a wonderful book club book. I think people would connect or relate to many aspects of the story. I don’t think it was bad, but I think it will really resonate with certain people and those people will soak it up and adore it….that person just isn’t me. 
12. 📱 **The Situationship** by *Abby Jimenez* - Another cute short story with some funny banter and funny situations. 😁 I giggled out loud multiple times in this one and I would love to have a longer story with these characters.
13. 🎧📱 **The Seven Year Slip** by *Ashley Poston* - So glad I finally got around to reading this one. I have loved all of Poston’s books I have read and this one gets a lot of hype. I did figure out the twist, but I was excited, not disappointed, I figured it out. I was trying to explain the story to my teen and her friends, and we all agreed it was a little confusing. Not so much when reading, but trying to tell someone what it is about? Be ready for some blank stares. 😁 And I'm looking forward to her new book coming out in June.
14. 🎧📖📱 **A Love Like The Sun** by *Riss M. Neilson* - I have to start by saying this cover is absolutely stunning!! Next, I had in my head this was a YA book….it was NOT and the spice level was much higher than I had expected. I enjoyed the story, although I wish the characters would have just communicated a little better. Friends-to-lovers and he-falls-first were cute. I also thought it kind of ended abruptly, though and there could have been more done with the “twist” at the end.
