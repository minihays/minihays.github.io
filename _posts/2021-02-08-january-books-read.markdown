I joined a book group on Facebook and it has been so wonderful. After many of those people made a collage of their books read by month, I decided to give it a try.

I liked most of these, but if you want full reviews, check out my [book instagram page](http://instagram.com/minihaysreads). Here is a summary of each of the books and a link for each.

1. [Peace Like a River](https://www.amazon.com/Peace-Like-River-Leif-Enger/dp/0802139256/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1612809319&sr=1-1) by Leif Enger (3/5):
> Enger brings us eleven-year-old Reuben Land, an asthmatic boy in the Midwest who has reason to believe in miracles. Along with his sister and father, Reuben finds himself on a cross-country search for his outlaw older brother who has been charged with murder. Their journey unfolds like a revelation, and its conclusion shows how family, love, and faith can stand up to the most terrifying of enemies, and the most tragic of fates.

2. [Verity](https://www.amazon.com/Verity-Colleen-Hoover/dp/1791392792/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=verity&qid=1612811708&s=books&sr=1-1) by Colleen Hoover (5/5): 
> Lowen Ashleigh is a struggling writer on the brink of financial ruin. When Jeremy Crawford, husband of bestselling author Verity Crawford, asks Lowen to complete the remaining books in a contract his permanently injured wife is unable to fulfill, Lowen has no choice but to accept. Lowen arrives at the Crawford home with the intention of only staying one or two nights—long enough to sort through Verity’s chaotic home office to collect all the notes and outlines she’ll need to start writing the first novel. But the more time Lowen spends with Jeremy Crawford, the less of a hurry she is in to leave. While there, Lowen uncovers a hidden manuscript. An autobiography containing chilling admissions Verity planned to take to her grave, including the truth behind the events that turned their lives upside down. A truth that, if revealed to Jeremy, would further devastate the already grieving father. Lowen decides to keep the manuscript a secret, allowing Jeremy to continue to believe Verity is merely an innocent, unfortunate victim of circumstance. But as Lowen’s feelings for the devoted father and husband deepen, she wonders if keeping Jeremy in the dark is in her own best interest. After all, if Jeremy were to read his wife’s autobiography, the disturbing truth would make it impossible for him to continue to love her. 

3. [The Vanishing Half](https://www.amazon.com/Vanishing-Half-Novel-Brit-Bennett/dp/0525536299/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1612811794&sr=1-1) by Brit Bennett (5/5):
> The Vignes twin sisters will always be identical. But after growing up together in a small, southern black community and running away at age sixteen, it's not just the shape of their daily lives that is different as adults, it's everything: their families, their communities, their racial identities. Many years later, one sister lives with her black daughter in the same southern town she once tried to escape. The other secretly passes for white, and her white husband knows nothing of her past. Still, even separated by so many miles and just as many lies, the fates of the twins remain intertwined. What will happen to the next generation, when their own daughters' storylines intersect?
>
> Weaving together multiple strands and generations of this family, from the Deep South to California, from the 1950s to the 1990s, Brit Bennett produces a story that is at once a riveting, emotional family story and a brilliant exploration of the American history of passing. Looking well beyond issues of race, The Vanishing Half considers the lasting influence of the past as it shapes a person's decisions, desires, and expectations, and explores some of the multiple reasons and realms in which people sometimes feel pulled to live as something other than their origins.
>
> As with her New York Times-bestselling debut The Mothers, Brit Bennett offers an engrossing page-turner about family and relationships that is immersive and provocative, compassionate and wise.

4. [The Wild Robot](https://www.amazon.com/Wild-Robot-Peter-Brown/dp/0316382000/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=the+wild+robot&qid=1612811916&s=books&sr=1-1) by Peter Brown (5/5):
> Can a robot survive in the wilderness?
>
> When robot Roz opens her eyes for the first time, she discovers that she is all alone on a remote, wild island. She has no idea how she got there or what her purpose is--but she knows she needs to survive. After battling a violent storm and escaping a vicious bear attack, she realizes that her only hope for survival is to adapt to her surroundings and learn from the island's unwelcoming animal inhabitants.
>
> As Roz slowly befriends the animals, the island starts to feel like home--until, one day, the robot's mysterious past comes back to haunt her.
>
> From bestselling and award-winning author and illustrator Peter Brown comes a heartwarming and action-packed novel about what happens when nature and technology collide.

5. [The Lost and Found Bookshop](https://www.amazon.com/Lost-Found-Bookshop-Novel/dp/006291412X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1USP11X0NHAVD&dchild=1&keywords=the+lost+and+found+bookshop+susan+wiggs&qid=1612812027&s=books&sprefix=the+lost+and+found%2Cstripbooks%2C190&sr=1-1) By Susan Wiggs (5/5):
> There is a book for everything . . . 
>
> Somewhere in the vast Library of the Universe, as Natalie thought of it, there was a book that embodied exactly the things she was worrying about.
>
> In the wake of a shocking tragedy, Natalie Harper inherits her mother’s charming but financially strapped bookshop in San Francisco. She also becomes caretaker for her ailing grandfather Andrew, her only living relative—not counting her scoundrel father.
>
> But the gruff, deeply kind Andrew has begun displaying signs of decline. Natalie thinks it’s best to move him to an assisted living facility to ensure the care he needs. To pay for it, she plans to close the bookstore and sell the derelict but valuable building on historic Perdita Street, which is in need of constant fixing. There’s only one problem–Grandpa Andrew owns the building and refuses to sell. Natalie adores her grandfather; she’ll do whatever it takes to make his final years happy. Besides, she loves the store and its books provide welcome solace for her overwhelming grief.
>
> After she moves into the small studio apartment above the shop, Natalie carries out her grandfather’s request and hires contractor Peach Gallagher to do the necessary and ongoing repairs. His young daughter, Dorothy, also becomes a regular at the store, and she and Natalie begin reading together while Peach works.
>
> To Natalie’s surprise, her sorrow begins to dissipate as her life becomes an unexpected journey of new connections, discoveries and revelations, from unearthing artifacts hidden in the bookshop’s walls, to discovering the truth about her family, her future, and her own heart.

6. [The Little Book of Hygge](https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Hygge-Danish-Secrets/dp/0062658808/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1612812130&sr=1-1) by Meik Wiking (4/5):
> Why are Danes the happiest people in the world? The answer, says Meik Wiking, CEO of the Happiness Research Institute in Copenhagen, is Hygge. Loosely translated, Hygge―pronounced Hoo-ga―is a sense of comfort, togetherness, and well-being. "Hygge is about an atmosphere and an experience," Wiking explains. "It is about being with the people we love. A feeling of home. A feeling that we are safe."
> 
> Hygge is the sensation you get when you’re cuddled up on a sofa, in cozy socks under a soft throw, during a storm. It’s that feeling when you’re sharing comfort food and easy conversation with loved ones at a candlelit table. It is the warmth of morning light shining just right on a crisp blue-sky day.
> 
> The Little Book of Hygge introduces you to this cornerstone of Danish life, and offers advice and ideas on incorporating it into your own life, such as:
> 
> * Get comfy. Take a break.
> * Be here now. Turn off the phones.
> * Turn down the lights. Bring out the candles.
> * Build relationships. Spend time with your tribe.
> * Give yourself a break from the demands of healthy living. Cake is most definitely Hygge.
> * Live life today, like there is no coffee tomorrow.
>
> From picking the right lighting to organizing a Hygge get-together to dressing hygge, Wiking shows you how to experience more joy and contentment the Danish way.

7. [We Dream of Space](https://www.amazon.com/Dream-Space-Erin-Entrada-Kelly/dp/0062747304/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=we+dream+of+space&qid=1612813104&s=books&sr=1-1) by Erin Entrada Kelly (3/5):
> Newbery Medalist and New York Times–bestselling author Erin Entrada Kelly transports readers to 1986 and introduces them to the unforgettable Cash, Fitch, and Bird Nelson Thomas in this pitch-perfect middle grade novel about family, friendship, science, and exploration. This acclaimed Newbery Honor Book is a great choice for readers of Kate DiCamillo, Rita Williams-Garcia, and Rebecca Stead.
>
> Cash, Fitch, and Bird Nelson Thomas are three siblings in seventh grade together in Park, Delaware. In 1986, as the country waits expectantly for the launch of the space shuttle Challenger, they each struggle with their own personal anxieties. Cash, who loves basketball but has a newly broken wrist, is in danger of failing seventh grade for the second time. Fitch spends every afternoon playing Major Havoc at the arcade on Main and wrestles with an explosive temper that he doesn’t understand. And Bird, his twelve-year-old twin, dreams of being NASA’s first female shuttle commander, but feels like she’s disappearing. 
> 
> The Nelson Thomas children exist in their own orbits, circling a tense and unpredictable household, with little in common except an enthusiastic science teacher named Ms. Salonga.

When the fated day finally arrives, it changes all of their lives and brings them together in unexpected ways.
>

8. [Beatrice Zinker - Incognito](https://www.amazon.com/Beatrice-Zinker-Upside-Thinker-Incognito/dp/1484768159/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=beatrice+Zinker&qid=1612813272&s=books&sr=1-3) by Shelley Johannes (4/5):

> 
> Lying low isn't exactly Beatrice's strong suit . . . and her classmate Wes desperately needs to be recognized. When Wes's certificate falls into the wrong hands, Beatrice and her best friend, Lenny, must find a way once again, to save Operation Upside-and themselves-from big trouble.

9. [Layla](https://www.amazon.com/Layla-Colleen-Hoover/dp/1542000173/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=layla&qid=1612813357&s=books&sr=1-1) by Colleen Hoover (5/5):
> When Leeds meets Layla, he’s convinced he’ll spend the rest of his life with her—until an unexpected attack leaves Layla fighting for her life. After weeks in the hospital, Layla recovers physically, but the emotional and mental scarring has altered the woman Leeds fell in love with. In order to put their relationship back on track, Leeds whisks Layla away to the bed-and-breakfast where they first met. Once they arrive, Layla’s behavior takes a bizarre turn. And that’s just one of many inexplicable occurrences.
>

As his curiosity for Willow grows, his decision to help her find answers puts him in direct conflict with Layla’s well-being. Leeds soon realizes he has to make a choice because he can’t help both of them. But if he makes the wrong choice, it could be detrimental for all of them.

10. [Wintering](https://www.amazon.com/Wintering-Power-Retreat-Difficult-Times/dp/0593189485/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=wintering&qid=1612813437&s=books&sr=1-1) by Katherine May (4/5):
> Sometimes you slip through the cracks: unforeseen circumstances like an abrupt illness, the death of a loved one, a break up, or a job loss can derail a life. These periods of dislocation can be lonely and unexpected. For May, her husband fell ill, her son stopped attending school, and her own medical issues led her to leave a demanding job. Wintering explores how she not only endured this painful time, but embraced the singular opportunities it offered.
>
> A moving personal narrative shot through with lessons from literature, mythology, and the natural world, May's story offers instruction on the transformative power of rest and retreat. Illumination emerges from many sources: solstice celebrations and dormice hibernation, C.S. Lewis and Sylvia Plath, swimming in icy waters and sailing arctic seas.
> 
> Ultimately Wintering invites us to change how we relate to our own fallow times. May models an active acceptance of sadness and finds nourishment in deep retreat, joy in the hushed beauty of winter, and encouragement in understanding life as cyclical, not linear. A secular mystic, May forms a guiding philosophy for transforming the hardships that arise before the ushering in of a new season.

11. [Regretting You](https://www.amazon.com/Regretting-You-Colleen-Hoover/dp/1542016428/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=regretting+you&qid=1612813505&s=books&sr=1-1) by Colleen Hoover (5/5):

>

>
> With warring personalities and conflicting goals, Morgan and Clara find it increasingly difficult to coexist. The only person who can bring peace to the household is Chris—Morgan’s husband, Clara’s father, and the family anchor. But that peace is shattered when Chris is involved in a tragic and questionable accident. The heartbreaking and long-lasting consequences will reach far beyond just Morgan and Clara.
>
> While struggling to rebuild everything that crashed around them, Morgan finds comfort in the last person she expects to, and Clara turns to the one boy she’s been forbidden to see. With each passing day, new secrets, resentment, and misunderstandings make mother and daughter fall further apart. So far apart, it might be impossible for them to ever fall back together.

12. [Dark Matter](https://www.amazon.com/Dark-Matter-Novel-Blake-Crouch/dp/1101904240/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=dark+matter&qid=1612813568&s=books&sr=1-1) by Blake Crouch (3/5):

>
> Before a man Jason’s never met smiles down at him and says, “Welcome back, my friend.” 
>
> In this world he’s woken up to, Jason’s life is not the one he knows. His wife is not his wife. His son was never born. And Jason is not an ordinary college physics professor, but a celebrated genius who has achieved something remarkable. Something impossible.
>
> Is it this world or the other that’s the dream? And even if the home he remembers is real, how can Jason possibly make it back to the family he loves? The answers lie in a journey more wondrous and horrifying than anything he could’ve imagined—one that will force him to confront the darkest parts of himself even as he battles a terrifying, seemingly unbeatable foe.
>
> Dark Matter is a brilliantly plotted tale that is at once sweeping and intimate, mind-bendingly strange and profoundly human—a relentlessly surprising science-fiction thriller about choices, paths not taken, and how far we’ll go to claim the lives we dream of.

13. [Mexican Gothic](https://www.amazon.com/Mexican-Gothic-Silvia-Moreno-Garcia/dp/0525620788/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=mexican+gothic&qid=1612813651&s=books&sr=1-1) by Silvia Moreno-Garcia (3/5):
> After receiving a frantic letter from her newly-wed cousin begging for someone to save her from a mysterious doom, Noemí Taboada heads to High Place, a distant house in the Mexican countryside. She’s not sure what she will find—her cousin’s husband, a handsome Englishman, is a stranger, and Noemí knows little about the region.   
> 
> Noemí is also an unlikely rescuer: She’s a glamorous debutante, and her chic gowns and perfect red lipstick are more suited for cocktail parties than amateur sleuthing. But she’s also tough and smart, with an indomitable will, and she is not afraid: Not of her cousin’s new husband, who is both menacing and alluring; not of his father, the ancient patriarch who seems to be fascinated by Noemí; and not even of the house itself, which begins to invade Noemi’s dreams with visions of blood and doom.
> 
> Her only ally in this inhospitable abode is the family’s youngest son. Shy and gentle, he seems to want to help Noemí, but might also be hiding dark knowledge of his family’s past. For there are many secrets behind the walls of High Place. The family’s once colossal wealth and faded mining empire kept them from prying eyes, but as Noemí digs deeper she unearths stories of violence and madness. 
>
> And Noemí, mesmerized by the terrifying yet seductive world of High Place, may soon find it impossible to ever leave this enigmatic house behind.
