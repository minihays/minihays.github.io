I have always loved seeing a [Little Free Library](https://littlefreelibrary.org/) while I am wandering around. I always take pictures of them and love to see what book treasures are inside. Some days I find lots of good books and other days, nothing is appealing to me. 

My dream is to build one at our new house. I had a vision of having one at our last house, but it just didn't work out. Now that we are going to have a big shop space, I can't wait to make one and fill it with books! 

Here are some of my favorites I have found over the years.

>This one we found on a recent walk we went on. I had to stop the car just to take a picture. It was stunning!

>This was one that a friend posted was near her house. The rainbow on the roof was my favorite. I want to add some rainbows to mine. And even more exciting, our new home is nearby this one.

>This was near one of the kids' schools and I loved it's clean look, but the solar panel on the top was what really caught my eye!

>This was one in our old neighborhood and loved how it was set back in the trees. It felt so whimsical.

>There's something so clean and classic about this house. I love that it has actual roofing on the roof.

>This one is in the neighborhood we are living in over the summer. I love that it appears the kids were given some paint and told to go nuts! 

So these are some I have found over the years that have caught my eye. There have been MANY others. I can't wait to create one of my own! 

Have you found any Little Free Libraries that you have loved? Do you take books when you find them? Do you ever leave books? Have you found something other than books in a LFL?
