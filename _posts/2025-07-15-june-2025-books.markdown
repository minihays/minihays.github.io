Here are the 9 books I read in June. I really love these collages to see the books from each month in one place. They make me really happy to make them.

I hope you find something that looks interesting to you. Below are a few notes on the books this month.

**Total books for the year: 84**

1. 🎧 **Death Of The Author** by *Nnedi Okorafor* - There was a lot going on in this book. Not in a bad way. There was Sci-Fi, writing, a book inside a book, a FMC with a disability who has to fight for her own identity. I enjoyed it as a whole, but almost wish it was a bit shorter. At 450 pages, it was a long read.
2. 🎧 **The Last Murder At The End Of The World** by *Stuart Turton* - I didn’t really love this one , but I felt like it was made better because a friend read it as well, and we ended up talking about it. I am not sure I would have stuck this one out otherwise. But the paperback version and sprayed edges are gorgeous!
3. 🎧 **Zero Stars, Do Not Recommend** by *MJ Wassmer* - This was just a funny and silly read. I guessed what was happening part way through, but I still enjoyed this one. There were some amusing characters and was an overall entertaining read.
4. 🎧 **The In-Between Bookstore** by *Edward Underhill* - I really liked this one. It was a unique story with LGBTQ characters, time travel and self-discovery. It was magical and lovely and one I will need in my collection. 
5. 📱 **Delicates** by *Brenna Thummler* - This was book 2 in this series and I absolutely adore it. This story was a continuation of the first book. I am not even sure I can say why I love this so much, but I do. I love the characters, the ghosts and it’s just really heartwarming. 
6. 🎧 **The Tenant** by *Freida McFadden* - I am going to call this a typical Freida McFadden book. It was good, not mind-blowing or earth-shattering, but an enjoyable and entertaining read.
7. 🎧 **Quantum Love Story** By *Mike Chen* - This book just did nothing for me. It was a bit dull. Maybe because I had just read another time travel book I really enjoyed. I was distracted and just not really into this one.
8. 📖 **Maus** by *Art Spiegelman* - This has been on my list for a LONG time and I’m glad I finally read it. I think I avoided it because it was a graphic novel, but I have broadened my horizons and really enjoyed it. It was a bit slow to read at times because one character had a heavy accent so you had to re-read parts to know what was said. But what a creative way to tell such a hard story using animals. I will be reading book 2, as well.
9. 🎧 **Kiss Countdown** by *Etta Easton* - This was a cute book. I thought the story was fun and I liked the characters and even really liked the secondary characters. It wasn’t the best one I’ve ever read, but I really liked it.
