Here are the 6 books I read in July. One of them will be added to my favorites list, some I really liked and others were just ok.

Check out my [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/48253141) page for ⭐️ ratings of these books. I started trying out [Fable](https://fable.co/minihays-147798854824) recently. I'm still figuring out how it works, but feel free to check that out. I hope you find something that looks interesting to you. Below are a few notes on the books this month.

**Total books for the year: 70**

1. 🎧 **The Change** by *Kirsten Miller* -- This was so good. I loved this and knew I had to read everything by her after reading Lula Dean last month.
2. 📖📱 **The Love Of My Afterlife** by *Kristy Greenwood -- I picked this one up on a whim at Costco and I loved it. It had me laughing from the very beginning.
3. 🎧📖📱 **Bookish People** by *Susan Coll* -- I wanted to love this one so much. It was just ok, but the cover is adorable!
4. 🎧 **The Last Word** by *Taylor Adams* -- This one was a little weird. It was creepy and good at parts and other parts I was annoyed. It was ok.
5. 🎧 **You'd Look Better As A Ghost** by *Joanna Wallace* -- Same for this one. Parts I liked and others I didn't. Just ok.
6. 🎧📖📱 **Small Town Big Magic** by *Hazel Beck* -- I purchased this at a book signing with Kirsten Miller and I thought the cover was so dang cute. I knew nothing about it, but ended up loving it and I'm currently reading book 3 now.
