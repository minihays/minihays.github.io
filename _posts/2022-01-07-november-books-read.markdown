Here is a link for each of the books and summaries for each. I hope you find something that looks interesting to you. 

1. [This Is How It Always Is](https://www.amazon.com/This-How-Always-Laurie-Frankel-ebook/dp/B01HW6Z3FG/ref=sr_1_1?crid=18EIEDVC83X4G&keywords=this+is+how+it+always+is&qid=1641607507&sprefix=this+is+how%2Caps%2C201&sr=8-1) by Laurie Frankel
>*This is how* a family keeps a secret…and how that secret ends up keeping them.
>
>*This is how* a family lives happily ever after…until happily ever after becomes complicated.
>
>*This is how* children change…and then change the world.
>
>This is Claude. He’s five years old, the youngest of five brothers, and loves peanut butter sandwiches. He also loves wearing a dress, and dreams of being a princess.
>
>When he grows up, Claude says, he wants to be a girl.
>
>Rosie and Penn want Claude to be whoever Claude wants to be. They’re just not sure they’re ready to share that with the world. Soon the entire family is keeping Claude’s secret. Until one day it explodes.
>
>Laurie Frankel's This Is How It Always Is is a novel about revelations, transformations, fairy tales, and family. And it’s about the ways this is how it always is: Change is always hard and miraculous and hard again, parenting is always a leap into the unknown with crossed fingers and full hearts, children grow but not always according to plan. And families with secrets don’t get to keep them forever.

2. [A Good Kind Of Trouble](https://www.amazon.com/Good-Kind-Trouble-Moore-Ram%C3%A9e/dp/0062836692/ref=sr_1_1?crid=14OZ73O268MT5&keywords=a+good+kind+of+trouble&qid=1641607627&sprefix=a+good+kind+of+trouble%2Caps%2C104&sr=8-1) by Lisa Moore Ramee
>Twelve-year-old Shayla is allergic to trouble. All she wants to do is to follow the rules. (Oh, and she’d also like to make it through seventh grade with her best friendships intact, learn to run track, and have a cute boy see past her giant forehead.)
>
>But in junior high, it’s like all the rules have changed. Now she’s suddenly questioning who her best friends are and some people at school are saying she’s not black enough. Wait, what?
>
>Shay’s sister, Hana, is involved in Black Lives Matter, but Shay doesn't think that's for her. After experiencing a powerful protest, though, Shay decides some rules are worth breaking. She starts wearing an armband to school in support of the Black Lives movement. Soon everyone is taking sides. And she is given an ultimatum.
>
>Shay is scared to do the wrong thing (and even more scared to do the right thing), but if she doesn't face her fear, she'll be forever tripping over the next hurdle. Now that’s trouble, for real.

3. [What Stars Are Made Of](https://www.amazon.com/What-Stars-Made-Sarah-Allen/dp/1250763290/ref=sr_1_1?crid=305H50L6WMUKR&keywords=What+stars+are+made+of&qid=1641607715&sprefix=what+stars+are+made+of%2Caps%2C107&sr=8-1) by Sarah Allen
>Twelve-year-old Libby Monroe is great at science, being optimistic, and talking to her famous, accomplished friends (okay, maybe that last one is only in her head). She’s not great at playing piano, sitting still, or figuring out how to say the right thing at the right time in real life. Libby was born with Turner Syndrome, and that makes some things hard. But she has lots of people who love her, and that makes her pretty lucky.
>
>When her big sister Nonny tells her she’s pregnant, Libby is thrilled―but worried. Nonny and her husband are in a financial black hole, and Libby knows that babies aren’t always born healthy. So she strikes a deal with the universe: She’ll enter a contest with a project about Cecelia Payne, the first person to discover what stars are made of. If she wins the grand prize and gives all that money to Nonny’s family, then the baby will be perfect. Does she have what it takes to care for the sister that has always cared for her? And what will it take for the universe to notice?

4. [Some Girls Do](https://www.amazon.com/Some-Girls-Do-Jennifer-Dugan-ebook/dp/B08GJVBL4J/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3L3YM5BCGTS53&keywords=some+girls+do&qid=1641607771&sprefix=some+girls+do%2Caps%2C113&sr=8-1) by Jennifer Dugan
>Morgan, an elite track athlete, is forced to transfer high schools late in her senior year after it turns out being queer is against her private Catholic school's code of conduct. There, she meets Ruby, who has two hobbies: tinkering with her baby blue 1970 Ford Torino and competing in local beauty pageants, the latter to live out the dreams of her overbearing mother. The two are drawn to each other and can't deny their growing feelings. But while Morgan--out and proud, and determined to have a fresh start--doesn't want to have to keep their budding relationship a secret, Ruby isn't ready to come out yet. With each girl on a different path toward living her truth, can they go the distance together?

Finn even has a new ghost friend, Isabella, to show him the ropes. But he also has a lot of BIG questions, like: who wanted him dead? And can he stop the maniac from striking again? 
>

Self-confessed workaholic and screenwriter Adam Wright has lived with face blindness his whole life. He can’t recognize friends or family, or even his own wife.
>
>Every anniversary the couple exchange traditional gifts--paper, cotton, pottery, tin--and each year Adam’s wife writes him a letter that she never lets him read. Until now. They both know this weekend will make or break their marriage, but they didn’t randomly win this trip. One of them is lying, and someone doesn’t want them to live happily ever after.

Jonah’s preexisting anxiety is about to become an epic daily struggle. As Max and Jonah get to know each other through FaceTime dates, socially distanced playground hangs, and the escalating heartbreaks of the pandemic, they’re pushed apart by what they don’t share and pulled closer by what they do.
>
>As thoughtful, probing, and informed as it is buoyant, romantic, and funny, Hello (From Here) cuts across differences in class, privilege, and mental health, all thrown into stark relief by the COVID-19 pandemic. Here’s a novel that looks at the first two months of the quarantine, and adds falling in love to the mess.

8. [My Life In France](https://www.amazon.com/My-Life-France-Julia-Child-ebook/dp/B000GCFCI2/ref=sr_1_1?crid=XGGYMO56WU2P&keywords=my+life+in+france&qid=1641608062&sprefix=my+life+in+franc%2Caps%2C108&sr=8-1) by Julia Child
>Although she would later singlehandedly create a new approach to American cuisine with her cookbook Mastering the Art of French Cooking and her television show The French Chef, Julia Child was not always a master chef. Indeed, when she first arrived in France in 1948 with her husband, Paul, who was to work for the USIS, she spoke no French and knew nothing about the country itself.
>
>But as she dove into French culture, buying food at local markets and taking classes at the Cordon Bleu, her life changed forever with her newfound passion for cooking and teaching. Julia’s unforgettable story—struggles with the head of the Cordon Bleu, rejections from publishers to whom she sent her now-famous cookbook, a wonderful, nearly fifty-year long marriage that took the Childs across the globe—unfolds with the spirit so key to Julia’s success as a chef and a writer, brilliantly capturing one of America’s most endearing personalities.

9. [The Book Woman of Troublesome Creek](https://www.amazon.com/Book-Woman-Troublesome-Creek-Novel-ebook/dp/B07LGD67ZZ/ref=sr_1_1?crid=4KNFK5Z8TK7V&keywords=troublesome+creek&qid=1641608141&sprefix=troublesome+creek%2Caps%2C114&sr=8-1) by Kim Michele Richardson
>The hardscrabble folks of Troublesome Creek have to scrap for everything—everything except books, that is. Thanks to Roosevelt's Kentucky Pack Horse Library Project, Troublesome's got its very own traveling librarian, Cussy Mary Carter.
>
>Cussy's not only a book woman, however, she's also the last of her kind, her skin a shade of blue unlike most anyone else. Not everyone is keen on Cussy's family or the Library Project, and a Blue is often blamed for any whiff of trouble. If Cussy wants to bring the joy of books to the hill folks, she's going to have to confront prejudice as old as the Appalachias and suspicion as deep as the holler.
>
>Inspired by the true blue-skinned people of Kentucky and the brave and dedicated Kentucky Pack Horse library service of the 1930s, The Book Woman of Troublesome Creek is a story of raw courage, fierce strength, and one woman's belief that books can carry us anywhere—even back home.

10. [Eat, Pray, #FML](https://www.amazon.com/Eat-Pray-FML-Gabrielle-Stone-ebook/dp/B07TGSJXNB/ref=sr_1_1?crid=20O1BGXWSIKW0&keywords=eat+pray+fml&qid=1641608226&sprefix=eat+pray+fml%2Caps%2C111&sr=8-1) by Gabrielle Stone
>A year and a half into our marriage, I found out my husband had been having an affair with a nineteen-year-old for six months. I filed for divorce and left.
>
>Two weeks later I met a man, and we fell madly in love. It was a fairy-tale romance for a month and a half, and he convinced me to join him on a romantic month-long vacation in Italy. Forty-eight hours before we were supposed to get on a plane, he told me he needed to go by himself. I was devastated. So, I had a decision to make. Either stay home and be heartbroken, or go travel Europe for a month by myself. And staying at home heartbroken?
>
>F%*k. That. What does a woman do when her life has fallen apart and her heart has been ripped out and stepped on twice in two months? She goes on a wild adventure, makes some bad decisions, and does a sh*t load of soul searching. But most importantly? She finds out how to love…herself.
>
>This is so not Eat, Pray, Love.
>
>This is **Eat, Pray, #FML**.

11. [The Paper Palace](https://www.amazon.com/Paper-Palace-Miranda-Cowley-Heller-ebook/dp/B08NFT8N8F/ref=sr_1_1?crid=336VTZW42ZDIH&keywords=the+paper+palace&qid=1641608321&sprefix=the+paper+palace%2Caps%2C110&sr=8-1) by Miranda Cowley Heller
>It is a perfect August morning, and Elle, a fifty-year-old happily married mother of three, awakens at “The Paper Palace”—the family summer place which she has visited every summer of her life. But this morning is different: last night Elle and her oldest friend Jonas crept out the back door into the darkness and had sex with each other for the first time, all while their spouses chatted away inside. Now, over the next twenty-four hours, Elle will have to decide between the life she has made with her genuinely beloved husband, Peter, and the life she always imagined she would have had with her childhood love, Jonas, if a tragic event hadn’t forever changed the course of their lives. As Heller colors in the experiences that have led Elle to this day, we arrive at her ultimate decision with all its complexity. Tender yet devastating, The Paper Palace considers the tensions between desire and dignity, the legacies of abuse, and the crimes and misdemeanors of families.

>
>Michael is a mixed-race gay teen growing up in London. All his life, he’s navigated what it means to be Greek-Cypriot and Jamaican—but never quite feeling Greek or Black enough.
>
>As he gets older, Michael’s coming out is only the start of learning who he is and where he fits in. When he discovers the Drag Society, he finally finds where he belongs—and the Black Flamingo is born.
>
>Told with raw honesty, insight, and lyricism, this debut explores the layers of identity that make us who we are—and allow us to shine.
