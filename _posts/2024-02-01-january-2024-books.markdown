Here are the 9 books I read in January. I decided I'm not going to post each of my books on instagram anymore. Maybe when I have a favorite or maybe not. But I am still making the collages of my monthly reads because they make me happy.

Here are the books I read in order. I hope you find something that looks interesting to you.
