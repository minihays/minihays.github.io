It has taken me a very long time to accept the idea of not finishing a book. Or just allowing myself to realize I am not enjoying it and to quit reading. But, it has been a very freeing feeling and these are the books that haven't made the cut for me this year.

There's a bit of a fine line and some debating that happens in the book community over the idea of not finishing a book - also known as DNF (Did Not Finish). Some people can't leave a book unfinished. Some will come back to it and try again. Some have a certian amount of the book at which if they aren't connecting or enjoying the book, they quit. And there's a wide range of opinions and rules and feelings on this topic. 

As I said, I wasn't always ok with leaving something marked as DNF. Especially an audiobook. Party because I figure I can just loosely listen to it and at least get through it. I also didn't like to stop a book because I have come across many books that I wanted to quit, but stuck it out and ended up like the book because of the ending or how everything tied together.

But in 2021, I finally decided to embrace this idea and make a tag of DNF books to I could see. Then if for some reason I want to read it again one day, I'll be able to see that I didn't like it at some other time. Might save myself some time in the future.

So here are the books that I DNF and just couldn't get into this year.
