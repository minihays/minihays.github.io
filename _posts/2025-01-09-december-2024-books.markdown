Here are the 17 books I read in December. I had to power read a short story at the end because I was at 129 books and I couldn't allow myself to end on that. So I made it to 130 and I'm quite happy with that for the year.

Check out my [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/48253141) page for ⭐️ ratings of these books. I started trying out [Fable](https://fable.co/minihays-147798854824) recently, too. I am going to attempt [The StoryGraph](https://app.thestorygraph.com/stats/minihays?year=2025) in 2025. I hope you find something that looks interesting to you. Below are a few notes on the books this month.

**Total books for the year: 130**

1. 📱 **Cruel Winter With You** by *Ali Hazelwood* - I love everything by Ali Hazelwood. She is probably one of my favorite authors. This short story was so cute and enjoyable and a perfect winter read. 
2. 🎧📱 **Here One Moment** by *Liane Moriarty* - I wasn’t sure about my feelings on this one at the start of the book. I felt like I had a hard time remembering who the characters were at first so I felt kind of disconnected in the beginning. But by the end, I liked how everything was connected and pulled together and ended up enjoying this book. 
3. 🎧 **Tell Me Everything** by *Elizabeth Strout* - This was book 5 in this series by Strout. There’s something that isn’t overly remarkable, but also incredibly remarkable about the way she writes. It truly feels like she is just talking to you. This wasn’t my favorite in the series, but a lovely continuation. 
4. 📱 **Merry Ever After** by *Tessa Bailey* - This one was good but didn’t feel very believable. I think I maybe enjoy a slower burn. It just felt like it skipped forward too quickly at times even for a short story. I may need to read something else by the author and see if maybe this is just their style. 
5. 🎧 **The Wedding People** by *Alison Espach* - This was a surprise book for me. I’ve had it on my list for a long time and finally got around to reading it. And it didn’t disappoint. I laughed out loud so many times and even highlighted a few parts which I don’t do very often. Definitely one I’ll recommend to people!
6. 📱 **All By My Elf** by *Olivia Dade* - This was a cute story where the characters were stuck in a refurbished weenie mobile. The story was cute and I enjoyed the characters. I would read more by this author. 
7. 🎧📱 **Scattered Showers** by *Rainbow Rowell* - Scattered Showers was a short story compilation and the first book I’ve read by Rainbow Rowell. I believe there were 9 stories in this collection. Some I really liked and others were just ok, but overall, I enjoyed the book. 
8. 📱 **Merriment And Mayhem** by *Alexandria Bellefleur* - This one was hilarious. So many mishaps and funny situations packed into this short story. I need to find more books by this author.
9. 🎧📱 **Madwoman** by *Chelsea Bieker* - I had high hopes for this one, but it really fell short for me. I was not all that entertained and honestly had to look up the premise again because I forgot all about it. 
10. 🎧📱 **My Year Of Rest And Relaxation** by *Ottessa Moshfegh* - This was a weird one I came across, but ended up being fairly enjoyable. It was dark and a bit depressing, but I think that was the feeling the author was going for.
11. 📱 **Only Santas In The Building** by *Alexis Daria* - I really liked this one. It was a slow burn for the short story that it was, but it was comical and entertaining. 
12. 🎧📱 **Resting Scrooge Face** by *Meghan Quinn* - I loved this one, too. The Christmas stories were making me happy this year. This was a funny with with cute little turns. Lots of giggles. 
13. 🎧📱 **Oh. What. Fun** by *Chandler Baker* - This made my giggle and laugh out loud. It was just enough far-fetched that it could have been realistic. This would make a hilarous Christmas movie.
14. 📖📱👩‍👧‍👦 **Matt Sprouts and the Curse of the Ten Broken Toes** by *Matt Eicheldinger* - I read this with my youngest. He loved it. I just wanted it to be over. I thought the writing was kind of hard to read at times and didn't flow well. 
15. 🎧 **Slow Dance** by *Rainbow Rowell* - I may be on a Rainbow Rowell kick. I see what the hype was about with this one when it came out and I saw it everywhere. It was a a little slow, but it didn't feel slow if that makes sense. I was entertained and excited to see where the tory would go.
16. 🎧📱 **Holiday Hideaway** by *Mary Kay Andrews* - An overall feel-good holiday book. It was cute and silly and I enjoyed it.
17. 🎧📱 **Ushers** by *Joe Hill* - What a weird little story. I forgot I had this one, but was looking for a quick one to finish up the year. Not overly religious, but religious undertones with the angels of death. I think this would make a fantastic longer book and because I wanted more when it was done.

That's it for the year. On to 2025! Do you have some fun books you are looking forward to in the new year? Did you make it to your reading goal in 2024? Have you set your reading goal for 2025 yet? Happy reading to you!
