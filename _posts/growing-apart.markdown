I recently talked about the wide range of emotions I have been feeling. But I've also been struggling with friendships and how they have changed.

COVID did a number of friendships, at least for me. We have been extremely cautious from the beginning of COVID (1) because we trust science and scientists and (2) because Chuck has an auto-immune disease. Our strictness felt like it was frowned upon or we were looked at to be crazy in our neighborhood. Now, no one ever said anything to us. This is all the way I felt about the situation. I just want to make that clear.

A lot of people thought it was no big deal and allowed their kids to just conitnue to play all day like it was no big deal. Our kids watched other kids play together and then avoided them if they came near. It broke my heart, but I knew that we were doing the right thing.
