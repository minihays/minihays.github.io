Today is International Women's Day. Today is a day to celebrate women and all they do, can do and are going to do in the future.

From the [IWD website](https://www.internationalwomensday.com/), the theme for 2021 is #ChooseToChallege.

>A challenged world is an alert world. Individually, we're all responsible for our own thoughts and actions - all day, every day.
>
>We can all choose to challenge and call out gender bias and inequality. We can all choose to seek out and celebrate women's achievements. Collectively, we can all help create an inclusive world.
>
>From challenge comes change, so let's all choose to challenge.

My 10 year old daughter asked me to get her a feminist shirt. (I'll be shopping for shirts soon.) She is all about being strong and confident and it makes me so happy to see her growing into a girl who will take on the world. My 8 year old is following right in her footsteps. These girls are so tough and brave and smart and resilient and I am so proud! I want them to have the confidence I didn't always have as a girl (and sometimes as an adult). I want to teach them they can do anything they want and nothing should stand in their way. These girls love science, math, technology and I hope we continue to instill that desire to question, learn and solve problems.

Finally, in 2021, we saw a female Vice President. We are seeing more and more women in important and influential postions and this is so vital. Equality for women has been a struggle for so long. I'm starting to feel like we are getting better at this and going in the right direction, but we still aren't there quite yet.

Today, think about the women in your life and how amazing it would be if they really did have every opportunity and chance so succeed in their lives. Stand up for women everywhere and encourage them. And I urge you to do these things not just today, but everyday.
