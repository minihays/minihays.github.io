Here are the 14 books I read in March. There were a couple that were repeat authors (3 by one author and 2 by another).

I did end up changing my instagram format and the way I post my books. I may change again next month. But this was kind of fun so I may stick to this for a little while. It made me a little more excited to create the posts throughout the month. And since it is all just really journaling for me, it needs to be something I enjoy. 

If you want a little more on my thoughts for each of the books, check out my [bookstagram page - @minihaysreads](http://instagram.com/minihaysreads). 

Here is a link for each of the books. I hope you find something that looks interesting to you.
