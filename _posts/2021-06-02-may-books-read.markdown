Here are all the books I listened to in May. I didn't finish any Kindle or actual books this month. They were all audio books.

I knew that the crazy amount of books I was reading would slow down at some point and it turned out it was this month. There was more going into the office, more sports outside so more socializing instead of listening to books, and just didn't push to read more.And I'm totally ok with that.

I enjoyed the majority of these books, but if you want more on my thoughts, check out my [bookstagram page - @minihaysreads](http://instagram.com/minihaysreads). 

Here is a link for each of the books and summaries for each. I hope you find something that looks interesting to you. 

1. [Infinite Country](https://www.amazon.com/Infinite-Country-Novel-Patricia-Engel-ebook/dp/B08BZV8H5Q/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=infinite+country&qid=1622679682&sr=8-1) by Patricia Engel
> **I often wonder if we are living the wrong life in the wrong country.**
> 
> Talia is being held at a correctional facility for adolescent girls in the forested mountains of Colombia after committing an impulsive act of violence that may or may not have been warranted. She urgently needs to get out and get back home to Bogotá, where her father and a plane ticket to the United States are waiting for her. If she misses her flight, she might also miss her chance to finally be reunited with her family in the north.
>
> How this family came to occupy two different countries, two different worlds, comes into focus like twists of a kaleidoscope. We see Talia’s parents, Mauro and Elena, fall in love in a market stall as teenagers against a backdrop of civil war and social unrest. We see them leave Bogotá with their firstborn, Karina, in pursuit of safety and opportunity in the United States on a temporary visa, and we see the births of two more children, Nando and Talia, on American soil. We witness the decisions and indecisions that lead to Mauro’s deportation and the family’s splintering—the costs they’ve all been living with ever since.
>
> Award-winning, internationally acclaimed author Patricia Engel, herself a dual citizen and the daughter of Colombian immigrants, gives voice to all five family members as they navigate the particulars of their respective circumstances. And all the while, the metronome ticks: Will Talia make it to Bogotá in time? And if she does, can she bring herself to trade the solid facts of her father and life in Colombia for the distant vision of her mother and siblings in America?
>
> Rich with Bogotá urban life, steeped in Andean myth, and tense with the daily reality of the undocumented in America, Infinite Country is the story of two countries and one mixed-status family—for whom every triumph is stitched with regret, and every dream pursued bears the weight of a dream deferred.
