Every year I add a reading goal. This particular one counts the number of books you read. I have done this for almost 10 years now and I love keeping track of what I have read this way.

This challenge is through [Goodreads](http://goodreads.com). You can see reviews, follow friends, get book ideas, make reading lists and keep track of those books you have read. It's a great resource.

Here are a couple fun facts about the books I read this year. I read 60 books and over 20,000 pages. My goal was 50 books, but I surpassed that for the second year in a row.

And here are the actual books that I read this year. My last book is listed first, my first book listed last.

There is something so satisfying about looking at all the books I have read in a year. It is so satisfying and I feel so proud when I can scroll through them. I love having this memory to be able to remember some wonderful (and not so wonderful) books that I consumed this year. 

For 2021, I have set my reading goal to 60 books. Since I have hit that goal two years in a row, it was time to up my goal. I would love to be able to read 75 or 100 books in a year. That will definitely be a goal for me one day in the future. Also, I do include audiobooks, chapter books read with my kids and books I read myself. I read a LOT of children's books and picture books (bedtime usually), but I don't count these on my list.

So there it is...my 2020 in books!

**Ponder This:**
- Do you set a reading goal?
- Is your goal just number of books read or another challenge?
- Do you count audiobooks? Kid books?
- What is your reading goal for 2021?
- Have you read any of the books on my list?
- Have any of these books inspired you to add them to your reading list?
