Here are the 13 books I read in September. Toward the end of the month, I quit quite a few books and was having a hard time getting started or interested in the ones I have on hold. I'm thinking October might turn out to be a slower month.

Total books for the year: 122

If you want a little more on my thoughts for each of the books, check out my [bookstagram page - @minihaysreads](http://instagram.com/minihaysreads). 

Here is a link for each of the books, in the order I read them. I hope you find something that looks interesting to you.
