I read 6 books in June. Summer tends to be really busy, so I don't have nearly as much time for books as I do during the school year. If you want a little more on my thoughts for each of the books, check out my [bookstagram page - @minihaysreads](http://instagram.com/minihaysreads). 

Here is a link for each of the books. I hope you find something that looks interesting to you.
