Here are the 17 books I read in September. Yes. You read that number correctly. 17!

Check out my [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/48253141) page for ⭐️ ratings of these books. I started trying out [Fable](https://fable.co/minihays-147798854824) recently. I'm still figuring out how it works, but feel free to check that out. I hope you find something that looks interesting to you. Below are a few notes on the books this month.

**Total books for the year: 87**

1. 📱 **One Last Summer** by *Kate Spencer* - This was absolutely adorable. I read "In A New York Minute" by her and enjoyed it as well. The characters were lovable and I just devoured this one.
2. 🎧📖📱 **Big Little Spells** by *Hazel Beck* - Book two in this series. The first I picked up by chance and loved them. I even made some matching bracelets for this book set.
3. 🎧 **Real Life And Other Fictions** by *Susan Coll* - Meh. It was ok. I didn't like it, but can't really remember that much about the story.
4. 🎧 **Saving Noah** by *Dr. Lucinda Berry* - This one was good, but not the best psych thriller I have read. I did like the twist at the end!
5. 🎧 **The Chain** by *Adrian McKinty* - I really liked the first half of this book. I was so enthralled with the idea. Then the second half I just didn't like as much. It felt a bit dijointed from the first half.
6. 📖📱 **The Way Back Home** by *Courtney Peppernell* - I really love her poetry. It is comforting and relatable.
7. 🎧 **The Teacher** by *Freida McFadden* - I covered my mouth in shock at this twist. I didn't see that one coming at all. Some may not like the premise of this book, but I thought it was good.
8. 🎧📱 **Things We Left Behind** by *Lucy Score* - Finally finished this series and this 3rd book was definitely my favorite. I loved the MFC in this one!
9. 🎧📖 **The Printed Letter Bookshop** by *Katherine Reay* - I can't tell you anything about this one because I don't remember it at all. So maybe that says it all.
10. 🎧 **Not In Love** by *Ali Hazelwood* - I will read anything Ali writes. I love her MFC and just enjoy her writing.
11. 🎧📖 **A Novel Love Story** by *Ashley Poston* - This was my first Ashley Poston book (but I have two others on my TBR to read soon) and I just loved this. It was such a fun premise and a different twist on a love story. There was a bit of magic and I adored this one.
12. 🎧 **Wildfire** by *Hannah Grace* - This is book two (Icebreaker) and I really only read this one because I want to read book thee that has books on the cover. (hehe) But I ended up enjoying this one way more than Icebreaker. 
13. 🎧📖 **All The Colors Of The Dark** by *Chris Whitaker* - This was a slow burn book. I was unsure if I would finish this one, but I was glad I stuck it out. Not my favorite of the month (or year), but I do see why it has gotten so much hype lately.
14. 🎧 **The Perfect Marriage** by *Jeneva Rose* - I was told by someone that this was really good. And they were right. It was twisty right up until the end. Unlike the other by her I read where my friend and I figured out the twist early on.
15. 📖👩‍👧‍👦 **The One And Only Family** by *Katherine Applegate* - Book four (and maybe the final one) in this series. I can't say enough good things about this series. It's great to read with kids of various ages, as well as age appropriate and simple enough for kids young or older to read on their own. 
16. 📖📱 **Truly Madly Magically** by *Hazel Beck* - Book three in this witchy series and I just loved it. This one had probably the strongest MFC so far, but it took her a bit to find her way. I loved her and this book. Now to wait a year for the 4th book.
17. 🎧📖 **Attack Of The Black Rectangles** by *Amy Sarig King* - My middle schooler picked this out at the store and I couldn't pass up reading a book about censored books. This one was fabulous and a little different than just banning books. I loved it!
