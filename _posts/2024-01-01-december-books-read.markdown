Here are the 9 books I read in December. I had a couple books I was hoping to get done before the end of the year, and I just didn't have the time. But that means I will quickly have two books to add to my list for January!

[Total books for the year: 151](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/39936534) - I included a link to my GoodReads page with all my books.

If you want a little more on my thoughts for each of the books, check out my [bookstagram page - @minihaysreads](http://instagram.com/minihaysreads). 

Here is a link for each of the books, in the order I read them. I hope you find something that looks interesting to you.
