Here are the 13 books I read in October. What a perfect number for October! And I hit 100 books for the year this month, too.

Check out my [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/48253141) page for ⭐️ ratings of these books. I started trying out [Fable](https://fable.co/minihays-147798854824) recently. I'm still figuring out how it works, but feel free to check that out. I hope you find something that looks interesting to you. Below are a few notes on the books this month.

**Total books for the year: 100**

1. 🎧 **This Spells Love** by *Kate Robb* - This was absolutely adorable and a perfect way to start off October reading.
2. 🎧📖📱 **My Best Friend’s Exorcism** by *Grady Hendrix* - I love this cover. It was what drew me to this book in the first place. The story was a little weird, but was way better that the first Hendrix book I read.
3. 📖👩‍👧‍👦 **The Night Librarian** by *Christopher Lincoln* - My youngest and I read this graphic novel together after I grabbed it for him from a book store. Cute book and story, I just personally do not enjoy graphic novels. I get too confused trying to figure out where to read next. 
4. 🎧 **Never Lie** by *Freida McFadden* - This one was twisted and weird, but just ok. I feel like most of her books that I read are ok. Not great, not bad, but just quick entertainment.
5. 🎧 **The Fury** by *Alex Michaelides* - I didn't care for this one. I was kind of bored and confused at times. The POV was weird...tell a story - just kidding that wasn't what happened. Just kind of a weird way to unravel everything and it was not my favorite.
6. 🎧 **Nightbitch** by *Rachel Yoder* - This just sounded so interesting when I saw it - and it's becoming a movie, I think. The aspects of motherhood in this book were so well done and I found myself remembering lonely times as a first time mom and staying home with the kids. It definitely hit differently for me than it may others who didn't stay home with their kids.
7. 🎧📱📖 **The Dead Romantics** by *Ashley Poston* - I just loved this one. I have one more book by her to read and I am certain I will love it, too because her others I have read, I have loved. This was just a unique story and it was perfect for October!
8. 🎧📖 **The Story Collector** by *Evie Woods* - Meh. I was really hoping to like this one more, but it just really fell short for me. I kind of felt the same about her other book. Love the covers, stories are just ok.
9. 🎧📱 **The Very Secret Society Of Irregular Witches** by *Sangu Mandanna* - I had a hard time getting into this one. Maybe I had read too many witch books recently. By the end I enjoyed it, but I struggled at the beginning and almost quit.
10. 🎧 **The Banned Books Club** by *Brenda Novak* - This was ok. I originally got this as an ARC a while back and didn't finish it. Then when the audiobook came out, I thought I would give it another try. The story was not very lighthearted like I was hoping, but a lot of layers of issues. I wish there was more about book clubs in general and thought the title was a little misleading even though the book club was a tiny portion that tied together a couple things.
11. 🎧 **Rules For Ghosting** by *Shelly Jay Shore* - I loved the cover of this one and the premise. it was kind of a deep and emotional book at times, but that can be the case with death. It was a good story, but I feel like you need to be in the mood for it.
12. 🎧 **The Spellshop** by *Sarah Beth Durst* - This cover was gorgeous. I almost bought this one many times because it has beautiful sprayed purple edges...but it just wasn't that great. The best character by far was the sassy "magically sentient spider plant". He really kept me from DNFing this one. Kind of forgetable, but I want a living spider plant now.
13. 📱 **Rewitched** by *Lucy Jane Wood* - I read this book all. month. long. It wasn't bad, I just could not stay interested. It was a cute story, but I think it was a little too similar to a few others I had read recently. I did enjoy the book, I think the timing for me just wasn't great.
