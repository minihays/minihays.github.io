To say that 2020 was quite the year might be an understatement. I don't know anyone that hasn't been looking forward to 2020 ending and the beginning of 2021.

I am not one to do resolutions for the new year, but I am ready for a fresh start after everything that happened in 2020. I know that there is a long way to go to get back to normal, but I am so happy that there is a vaccine and some positive movement in the direction of returning to normalcy. 

We are going to start out the year continuing to do distance learning. Things have been going well for us and we just aren't quite ready for our kids to be there full time in-person with masks every day. 

Hockey will be starting up in the next couple days. There will be some changes - some which are the same as earlier in the year (no bags, no dressing at the rink, wearing masks during play). Some people are having a royal fit about this and it's the dumbest thing ever. One day we will laugh about this. "Remember when you/we had to wear masks to play hockey??!!" There is no reason to have an adult tantrum about it. Just be glad your kids can be back out there playing in a safe manner.

We are still limiting who we see and practicing social distancing and being safe until we can get the vaccine. It's already January. Spring will be around the corner before we know it. 

Not everything was bad in 2020. We built our [new house](https://andihays.dev/haysonthelake/) and moved in. We have spent more time with each other and have been able to cherish not having a schedule and spending more intentional time together. I have learned a lot about myself over this past year. Turned 40. I read 60 books (more on that tomorrow). And started this fancy new blog space.

I wish you all the best in the new year and I hope we all get a fresh start and can return back to normal in whatever manner back to normal we be from now on. Peace out 2020! Hello 2021.
