I can't believe I read 16 books in February. This blows my mind and makes me so excited.

I tried to read a few books for Black History Month that had been on my list (Concrete Rose, The Girl With The Louding Voice, One Crazy Summer and Born a Crime). I don't think you should just read books by black authors and about black people only in February, so there will be others as time goes on. But these were the few that worked out for this month. 

I liked most of the books this month, but if you want full reviews, check out my [bookstagram page](http://instagram.com/minihaysreads). Here is a summary and a link for each of the books. 

1. [You Have A Match](https://www.amazon.com/You-Have-Match-Emma-Lord/dp/1250237300/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1614798415&sr=8-1) by Emma Lord (4/5):
> When Abby signs up for a DNA service, it's mainly to give her friend and secret love interest, Leo, a nudge. After all, she knows who she is already: Avid photographer. Injury-prone tree climber. Best friend to Leo and Connie...although ever since the B.E.I. (Big Embarrassing Incident) with Leo, things have been awkward on that front.
>
> But she didn't know she's a younger sister.
>
> When the DNA service reveals Abby has a secret sister, shimmery-haired Instagram star Savannah Tully, it's hard to believe they're from the same planet, never mind the same parents ― especially considering Savannah, queen of green smoothies, is only a year and a half older than Abby herself.
>
> The logical course of action? Meet up at summer camp (obviously) and figure out why Abby's parents gave Savvy up for adoption. But there are complications: Savvy is a rigid rule-follower and total narc. Leo is the camp's co-chef, putting Abby's growing feelings for him on blast. And her parents have a secret that threatens to unravel everything.
>
> But part of life is showing up, leaning in, and learning to fit all your awkward pieces together. Because sometimes, the hardest things can also be the best ones.

2. [Beatrice Zinker - Sabotage](https://www.amazon.com/Sabotage-Beatrice-Zinker-Upside-Thinker/dp/1484768167/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=) by Shelley Johannes (4/5): 
> With several successful Operation Upside missions under their belts, Beatrice, her best friend Lenny, and Sam have made quite a name for themselves--they're the people who remind you there are infinite upsides to being yourself. But suddenly the unthinkable occurs--an imposter delivers an imitation Upside Award that could only be give by Beatrice, Lenny, or Sam!
> 
> As Beatrice hunts for clues to the culprit, Lenny suspects one of their own. Will they solve the mystery before Operation Upside becomes a fraud and is ruined once and for all? Or is the situation much bigger than any of them imagines?

3. [The Girl With The Louding Voice](https://www.amazon.com/Girl-Louding-Voice-Novel/dp/1524746096/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1614798656&sr=1-1) by Abi Dare (5/5):
> The unforgettable, inspiring story of a teenage girl growing up in a rural Nigerian village who longs to get an education so that she can find her “louding voice” and speak up for herself, The Girl with the Louding Voice is a simultaneously heartbreaking and triumphant tale about the power of fighting for your dreams.  Despite the seemingly insurmountable obstacles in her path, Adunni never loses sight of her goal of escaping the life of poverty she was born into so that she can build the future she chooses for herself – and help other girls like her do the same.  Her spirited determination to find joy and hope in even the most difficult circumstances imaginable will “break your heart and then put it back together again” (Jenna Bush Hager on The Today Show) even as Adunni shows us how one courageous young girl can inspire us all to reach for our dreams…and maybe even change the world.

4. [Daughters Of The Lake](https://www.amazon.com/Daughters-Lake-Wendy-Webb/dp/1503901335/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=daughters+of+the+lake&qid=1614798758&s=books&sr=1-1) by Wendy Webb (5/5):
> After the end of her marriage, Kate Granger has retreated to her parents’ home on Lake Superior to pull herself together—only to discover the body of a murdered woman washed into the shallows. Tucked in the folds of the woman’s curiously vintage gown is an infant, as cold and at peace as its mother. No one can identify the woman. Except for Kate. She’s seen her before. In her dreams…
>
> One hundred years ago, a love story ended in tragedy, its mysteries left unsolved. It’s time for the lake to give up its secrets. As each mystery unravels, it pulls Kate deeper into the eddy of a haunting folktale that has been handed down in whispers over generations. Now, it’s Kate’s turn to listen.
> 
> As the drowned woman reaches out from the grave, Kate reaches back. They must come together, if only in dreams, to right the sinister wrongs of the past.

5. [Heart Bones](https://www.amazon.com/Heart-Bones-Colleen-Hoover/dp/B08GLWCZTY/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=heart+bones&qid=1614798830&s=books&sr=1-1) By Colleen Hoover (4/5):
> Life and a dismal last name are the only two things Beyah Grim's parents ever gave her. After carving her path all on her own, Beyah is well on her way to bigger and better things, thanks to no one but herself. With only two short months separating her from the future she's built and the past she desperately wants to leave behind, an unexpected death leaves Beyah with no place to go during the interim. Forced to reach out to her last resort, Beyah has to spend the remainder of her summer on a peninsula in Texas with a father she barely knows. Beyah's plan is to keep her head down and let the summer slip by seamlessly, but her new neighbor Samson throws a wrench in that plan. Samson and Beyah have nothing in common on the surface. She comes from a life of poverty and neglect; he comes from a family of wealth and privilege. But one thing they do have in common is that they're both drawn to sad things. Which means they're drawn to each other. With an almost immediate connection too intense for them to continue denying, Beyah and Samson agree to stay in the shallow end of a summer fling. What Beyah doesn't realize is that a rip current is coming, and it's about to drag her heart out to sea.

> If there’s one thing seventeen-year-old Maverick Carter knows, it’s that a real man takes care of his family. As the son of a former gang legend, Mav does that the only way he knows how: dealing for the King Lords. With this money he can help his mom, who works two jobs while his dad’s in prison.

10. [Born A Crime](https://www.amazon.com/Born-Crime-Stories-African-Childhood/dp/0399588191/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1614799376&sr=1-1) by Trevor Noah (4/5):
> Trevor Noah’s unlikely path from apartheid South Africa to the desk of The Daily Show began with a criminal act: his birth. Trevor was born to a white Swiss father and a black Xhosa mother at a time when such a union was punishable by five years in prison. Living proof of his parents’ indiscretion, Trevor was kept mostly indoors for the earliest years of his life, bound by the extreme and often absurd measures his mother took to hide him from a government that could, at any moment, steal him away. Finally liberated by the end of South Africa’s tyrannical white rule, Trevor and his mother set forth on a grand adventure, living openly and freely and embracing the opportunities won by a centuries-long struggle.
>
> Born a Crime is the story of a mischievous young boy who grows into a restless young man as he struggles to find himself in a world where he was never supposed to exist. It is also the story of that young man’s relationship with his fearless, rebellious, and fervently religious mother—his teammate, a woman determined to save her son from the cycle of poverty, violence, and abuse that would ultimately threaten her own life.
>
> The stories collected here are by turns hilarious, dramatic, and deeply affecting. Whether subsisting on caterpillars for dinner during hard times, being thrown from a moving car during an attempted kidnapping, or just trying to survive the life-and-death pitfalls of dating in high school, Trevor illuminates his curious world with an incisive wit and unflinching honesty. His stories weave together to form a moving and searingly funny portrait of a boy making his way through a damaged world in a dangerous time, armed only with a keen sense of humor and a mother’s unconventional, unconditional love.

11. [Evicted](https://www.amazon.com/Evicted-Poverty-Profit-American-City-dp-0553447459/dp/0553447459/ref=mt_other?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=1614799446) by Matthew Desmond (3/5):

Its unforgettable scenes of hope and loss remind us of the centrality of home, without which nothing else is possible.

> Shoshanna Greenberg loves working at Once Upon, her favorite local bookstore. And with her moms fighting at home and her beloved car teetering on the brink of death, the store has become a welcome escape.
>
> When her boss announces a holiday bonus to the person who sells the most books, Shoshanna sees an opportunity to at least fix her car, if none of her other problems. The only person standing in her way? New hire Jake Kaplan.
> 
> Jake is an affront to everything Shoshanna stands for. He doesn’t even read! But somehow his sales start to rival hers. Jake may be cute (really cute), and he may be an eligible Jewish single (hard to find south of Atlanta), but he’s also the enemy, and Shoshanna is ready to take him down.
>
> But as the competition intensifies, Jake and Shoshanna grow closer and realize they might be more on the same page than either expects…
>
