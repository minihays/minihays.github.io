This was a puzzle I got because I was feeling down and in a rut and I wanted something to brighten my day. Rainbows always brighten my day and I love puzzles, so this was the perfect activity.

I don't usually do puzzles this way - starting in a corner or one side and moving my way along the puzzle. Ok, let's be honest here, I've NEVER done a puzzle this way before. But it seemed like the right thing to do with this one as I started pulling out pieces. Blue seemed like a logical color to start with, probably because I was sitting on that side of the puzzle. :)

The puzzle started out much more quickly than I thought it would. I was pleasntly surprised and a bit cocky about how good my puzzle skills are.

I just kept working my way through the puzzle. One friend told me she did the 100 piece version of this and it was tricky when you got to the reds/oranges. She was right! It was much more time consuming.

Then I sat in red-orange land for what felt like forever!

Eventually, I made my way out of the red-orange world and then flew through the rest of the puzzle. It was the perfect way to start my weekend...by finishing this beautiful puzzle. I will definitely do this one again when I need a challenging, but rewarding puzzle.

Do you put a puzzle together more than once? I will happily do a puzzle more than once, but I know a few people who will give them away and never do them again. I found that to be quite interesting, so I was wondering what the rest of you did. Or maybe you think doing puzzles are not fun at all, and I would totally understand that...But I think you're wrong. :)
