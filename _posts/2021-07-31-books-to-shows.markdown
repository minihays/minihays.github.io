More and more often it seems, books are turned into shows. It used to be they were turned into movies, but these days, I feel like I am seeing more books turned into miniseries or a show with a handful of episodes. I think that is partially to do with the way people watch shows. They like to watch them in hour chunks or binge a whole show more than they watch movies. This is just a guess. I like to do both, but I do find I prefer the shorter episodes.

I am curious how often you have watched something that is based on a book and how often you preferred the book over the show/movie. My 10 year old is learning this as she watches shows from books she read. She just says "they aren't the same" or "They left out so many parts".

Here are a few shows that have watched that are based on books.  

1. Firefly Lane
2. Big Little Lies
3. Little Fires Everywhere
4. Handmaid's Tale
5. Defending Jacob
6. Looking For Alaska
7. Sharp Objects
8. Me Before You
9. 

I am certain there are many more that I am leaving out, but these are the ones that came to my mind.

**Ponder This:**
- Do you like the book or the show better?
- Do you prefer to read the book before the show? Book after? Doesn't matter?
- What is one book turned show that you were really disappointed by?
