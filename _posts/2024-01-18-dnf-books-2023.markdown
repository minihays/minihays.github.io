This year may have been a record year for books I didn't finish. I quit 24 books in 2023. 

In 2021, I finally decided to embrace the idea of not finishing a book. I enjoy keeping a list of the ones I don't finish because sometimes, at a different time in life, it will be the right book and something I may really enjoy. 

These are the previous posts of books I didn't finish:
* [2022 DNF Books](https://andihays.dev/books/2023/02/07/dnf-books-2022.html)
* [2021 DNF Books](https://andihays.dev/books/2022/01/06/books-dnf.html)

One of the reasons I chose to do this in the first place is because I read/listen to A LOT of books (I read/listened to 151 books in 2023, 136 in 2022 and 150 in 2021). Sometimes I just can't get into the story/characters and find I am getting distracted and not paying attention or I am just struggling to want to read/finish it. In these cases, I choose to just move on. 

One hard thing for me to realize was that the world won't end if I decide not to finish a book. I am a huge advocate for reading. And reading whatever you want and makes you happy. Who cares what that book is or what genre it's in. If you like it....READ IT.

Your time is valuable, so if you aren't feeling a book, stop. Spend your time on something you enjoy.

Here are the books that I DNF and just couldn't get into this year - with a few notes on some of them.

- [The Ways We Hide](https://www.amazon.com/Ways-We-Hide-Novel/dp/1728249767/ref=monarch_sidesheet) by Kristina McMorris

  - A popular book by a well-know author, but I didn't enjoy it. Ware's books haven't been my favorite in the past.

  - Good story, I just couldn't get into it and it felt slow.
- [The Candy House](https://www.amazon.com/Candy-House-Novel-Jennifer-Egan/dp/1476716773/ref=monarch_sidesheet) by Jennifer Egan 
  - Fun cover, but I didn't realize this was book 2 in a series.

- [Fourth Wing](https://www.amazon.com/Fourth-Wing-Empyrean-Rebecca-Yarros/dp/1649374046/ref=monarch_sidesheet) by Rebecca Yarros 
  - I'm going to be disliked for this DNF. I talked to a friend about it to try to help me make it through and I was so utterly bored. I'm probably the only person on the planet who isn't in love with this series.
- [The Ogress And The Orphans](https://www.amazon.com/Ogress-Orphans-Kelly-Barnhill/dp/1643754017/ref=monarch_sidesheet) by Kelly Barnhill 
  - I will come back to this one. I was in the middle of a couple books when I read this, kept starting it and decided to just quit.
- [How To Stop Time](https://www.amazon.com/How-Stop-Time-Matt-Haig/dp/0525522891/ref=monarch_sidesheet) by Matt Haig 
  - I will probably try this one again. His book, The Midnight Library, is one of my favorites and I don't remember why I quit this one.
- [I'm Glad My Mom Died](https://www.amazon.com/Im-Glad-My-Mom-Died/dp/1668022842/ref=monarch_sidesheet) by Jennette McCurdy 
  - Not funny; didn't care.
- [Mean Baby](https://www.amazon.com/Mean-Baby-Memoir-Growing-Up/dp/059308277X/ref=monarch_sidesheet) by Selma Blair 
  - I heard good things about the audiobook, but realized I don't care about famous people and their lives.
- [All The Lonely People](https://www.amazon.com/All-Lonely-People-Mike-Gayle/dp/1538720175/ref=monarch_sidesheet) by Mike Gayle

  - I was so excited about this one and saw it everywhere. I just could not get into it. I will definitely try this one again, but we shall see.
