Are you more of a maximizer or a satisficer?

A *maximizer* is _______. A *satisficer* is _________. 

During the building of our house, I have had my share of meltdowns. Usually my meltdowns are related to things we have decided upon. Or more accurately, things I thought I wanted then thoroughly regretted my decision or talked myself out of something or just generally questioned every decision I ever made. 

People always say building a house is so hard. And I thought "what is so hard about it? I know what I want. This will be a piece of cake."
