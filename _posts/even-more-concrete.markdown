The next step was to build the basement walls. This meant a whole bunch of forms needed to be dropped off. These things were HUGE and I am thankful I didn't need to move them around!

They placed all the forms in their correct spaces. These mostly go along the walls that can't be built out of wood - so the walls that will be underground (those at the front of the house and partially as it angles down the hill). The large/tall section is going to be our spancrete garage. This is a garage under a garage that we will be using as our shop space. We cannot wait to start building things in this space!

Then they removed the forms after the concrete dried and they did some waterproofing and added some insulation in some places. It was a lot easier for me to see the shape of the house once the forms were off. I am terrible at visualizing things and this was very useful to my brain.

I felt a little bad as we were building the house because we were just meeting our neighbors and we had to say "nice to meet you, sorry for all the noises that are going to be happening." Thankfully, the neighbors on both sides have been really nice and very excited about us building something new and moving in. They've helped keep an eye on the house for us and have sent us progress pictures here and there. I'm so happy that we have such nice, thoughtful neighbors again.
