Here are the 8 books I read in March. I made one other change, I decided to start puttiing ⭐️ ratings back on my books on my [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/48253141) page.

Part of the reason for this change, is I have the memory of a rock these days and I read a lot of books. So people ask if I have read something or what I thought about it, and I have ZERO clue if I enjoyed it or not. Adding ratings back this year, on Goodreads only, felt like a good transition for me this year. Feel free to go check out my thoughts on my reads in 2024 on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/48253141) and add me as a friend if you'd like!

Here are the books I read in order this month. I hope you find something that looks interesting to you.
