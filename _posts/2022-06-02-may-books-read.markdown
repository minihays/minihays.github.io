I read 8 books in May. I was having a hard time really getting into books this month. If you want a little more on my thoughts for each of the books, check out my [bookstagram page - @minihaysreads](http://instagram.com/minihaysreads). 

Here is a link for each of the books. I hope you find something that looks interesting to you.
