I read 8 books in February. This was a pretty slow month. I actually had a lot of books ready at the library, but I skipped over a number of them this month. I just wasn't in the mood for some of them at the time. If you want a little more on my thoughts for each of the books, check out my [bookstagram page - @minihaysreads](http://instagram.com/minihaysreads). 

Here is a link for each of the books. I hope you find something that looks interesting to you.
