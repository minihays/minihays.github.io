Here are the 7 books I read in June. My reading always slows down a bit when school ends and the kids are home for the summer. There are new schedules and lots of summer activities. 

If you want a little more on my thoughts for each of the books, check out my [bookstagram page - @minihaysreads](http://instagram.com/minihaysreads). 

Here is a link for each of the books, in the order I read them. I hope you find something that looks interesting to you.
