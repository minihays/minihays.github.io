I read 10 books in August. This is double what I read in July. I am glad to have finished a few more this month. The kids go back to school soon, so who knows how many I'll finish next month! If you want a little more on my thoughts for each of the books, check out my [bookstagram page - @minihaysreads](http://instagram.com/minihaysreads).
