My little corner of the interwebs turns **-1-** today! I can hardly believe I've been playing around here for a year already. 

I have learned a lot from this site and I am hoping to grow and learn more as time goes on. I have enjoyed using this more bare bones platform than Wordpress. There is nothing wrong with Wordpress, but this has been a lot of fun to play around with all of the elements and see them change. Knowing I did it all. 

I am hoping to do some more web design as time goes on. I am learning more and even going to work on some websites for a couple friends. I feel like having this commitment to someone else will help me stick with this more than I have in the past. This way I have a reason to learn more and continue. When it's just my own place, I can just ignore it. So I am hoping this will help me stick with this aspect of programming and get me further into the tech industry. Wish me luck. I am really excited about this new and more intentional focus on something I have been slowly pursuing for years.
