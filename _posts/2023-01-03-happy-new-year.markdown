I hope you had a wonderful start to your new year!

We didn't do much on New Year's Eve, but snice my hubby's birthday is on New Year's Day, we were able to send the kids to grandma's house and we went out on a date. We ran some errands (which feel like a vacation sometimes without kids), had lunch, saw a movie and got some takeout to bring home. It was perfect.

I hope you were able to celebrate the New Year with your loved ones. Wishing you all the best in the New Year and all the possibilities that come with the fresh start!
