I read 5 books in July. I had high hopes of completing a couple more this month, but it didn't happen. I am guessing August will be a little light as well. Then I expect things to pick back up in September. If you want a little more on my thoughts for each of the books, check out my [bookstagram page - @minihaysreads](http://instagram.com/minihaysreads). 

Here is a link for each of the books. I hope you find something that looks interesting to you.
