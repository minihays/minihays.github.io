Here are the 11 books I read in November. Nothing overly exciting to report this month....just slowly working toward hitting my 150 book goal.

Total books for the year: 142

If you want a little more on my thoughts for each of the books, check out my [bookstagram page - @minihaysreads](http://instagram.com/minihaysreads).
