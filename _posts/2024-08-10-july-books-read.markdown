Here are the 9 books I read in July. One of them will be added to my favorites list, some I really liked and others were just ok.

Check out my [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/48253141) page for ⭐️ ratings of these books. I hope you find something that looks interesting to you. Below are a few notes on the books this month.

**Total books for the year: 64**

1. 🎧📖 **The Rom-Commers** by *Katherine Center* -- This was an adorable read and I love everything I read by Katherine Center! 
2. 🎧📱 **Funny Story** by *Emily Henry* -- This one was really good, too. I have enjoyed Emily Henry books, but I feel like some people haven't liked this one as much as some of her others, but I didn't get that feeling.
3. 🎧 **The Fellowship Of Puzzle Makers** by *Samuel Burr* -- I really wanted to love this book because I thought the cover was so cute. It wasn't bad, but it definitely wasn't as good as I was hoping. 
4. 🎧 **Before I Let Go** by *Kennedy Ryan* -- I would say this was kind of a slow burn book, but I had been hearing so many good reviews so I thought I would check it out. I really enjoyed it.
5. 🎧 **One True Loves** by *Taylor Jenkins Reid* -- This book had been popping up various places for me. I liked it, but thought a few parts were a little annoying at times. But overall, I thought this one's premise was really good.
6. 🎧 **Bride** by *Ali Hazelwood* -- I have read almost everything by Ali Hazelwood, and although there was some scrutiny to a scene in the book, I still had to read it. I knew something "weird" was coming at some point, but it didn't bother me. I love the strong female main characters in her books - who work in STEM - and was glad I finally read it.
7. 🎧 **The Lost Bookshop** by *Evie Woods* -- This had to be read because it was about a bookshop! It was cute, but not an overwhelming favorite. Just a cute bookish read. I do have this author's next book that I will be reading before too long, too.
8. 📱 **Lula Dean’s Little Library Of Banned Books** by *Kirsten Miller* -- This book was so so good! If you are against book banning and all the other shit going on in the world right now, this is a great book. A friend and I went to meet the author recently and get our books signed and she was just a delight! Read this one!!
9. 🎧 **Real Americans** by *Rachel Chong* -- This one just had a beautiful cover so I had to read it. The book was good, but I didn't love the ending. Each part was told by a different character and unraveled new information. It was a little long, but beautifully written overall.
