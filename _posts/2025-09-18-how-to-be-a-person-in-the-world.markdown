This poem is by the fabulous Lyndsay Rush ([@maryoliversdrunkcousin](https://www.instagram.com/maryoliversdrunkcousin/)). Her poetry beautifully and perfectly sums up the thoughts going through my mind recently during this dumpster fire called our country right now.

**How to Be a Person in the World**

Let the sorrow of it all sink deep into your bones <br>
but don’t forget to finish the laundry <br>
and water the lawn <br>
and dry your eyes <br>
Dream up a five year plan for your small business <br>
while picturing your baby doing a lockdown drill in his kindergarten classroom <br>
Discover new music <br>
and laugh at new jokes <br>
and let creativity dip from each of your fingertips <br>
but be mindful that you have neighbors who are starving and dying and fighting for the most basic of freedoms <br>
Look up how much protein you should be eating and also what to do if you’re in public with an active shooter <br>
Get your moles checked <br>
get your head checked <br>
get a mammogram <br>
and a grip <br>
and the new thriller book everyone’s talking about on TikTok <br>
but please, dear god, don’t forget the oceans! <br>
the ozone layer! <br>
the rhinos! <br>
the emails! <br>
the dogs and cats that need forever homes! <br>
Try to grapple with the fact that your parents are starting to get old-old <br>
but also with the future of AI <br>
and the pending recession <br>
and the billionaires <br>
and the depth of division between you and so many people you love <br>
It’s undeniable that everyone, everywhere is on the brink of losing their humanity <br>
and their empathy <br>
and their shit <br>
but to be a person in the world is to do the impossible <br>
every day <br>
simply by keeping your eyes open <br>
simply by getting out of bed <br>
simply by facing these incomprehensible horrors <br>
again and again <br>
without somehow abandoning your joy.
