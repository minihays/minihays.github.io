I am feeling small. My voice is small. I’m only one person. But I want to shout from the rooftops that we are all people, that we are all equal. Why is that not enough? 

Why do we need to **FIGHT** for rights at all? Why is it so unfair? And why don’t people see how unfair it is? I just can’t wrap my mind around it at all. 

Why am I less than a man? Why is my black friend less than a white person? Why is my trans friend less than any other person? Why is my gay friend less than for loving whomever they choose? 

Why do we decide these things at all? Why can’t it just be a given? 

Not all white people look the same, so why are we deemed correct or superior or better? It makes no sense. I am really struggling with how people can decide this. Or how they can be taught this growing up and then not realize it’s bullshit and insane. 

If you are a human: you get rights. And your rights will be EXACTLY the same as every other right every other human gets.

**END OF DISCUSSION.**

You can vote. You can get married. You can buy a house on your own. You choose what happens to your body. You get the same amount of pay as your coworker doing the same job. You are heard when you voice your opinion. You are allowed to have any job or career you like. You are allowed to live your life without someone else deciding those things for you.

Why is this so hard?

I feel small. It feels like nothing little me can do is enough. I don't think it's meaningless or not worth it to speak out, but it definitely just doesn't feel like enough. I'll put my signs up in my yard. I will stand up for what I believe in and I'll stand up for you. Because maybe you are feeling small and are just one person like me...but we exist. We may be small and our voices are but one person's, but it doesn't mean that we will be silent.
