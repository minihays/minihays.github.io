I wanted to do a little recap of the books I have completed so far this year to get me caught up to start doing some book reviews here. I didn't want to do a post for all of them, but figured I shouldn't leave out everything I've read so far in 2020, either. So here's a little summary.

For the last few years I have done a reading goal on [goodreads](http://goodreads.com). The past couple years my goal has been 50 books. I have been able to meet (and sometimes exceed my goal) greatly due to listening to audiobooks.

These are the books I have read so far this year. The most recent book is *Oona Out of Order* and the first book I read this year was *The Goldfinch*.

Some of these books have been for book club and others have been just for fun. A couple have been books I have read with my girls at bedtime and I counted them because they were chapter books. Some of my favorites from this list were:
- [Red White and Royal Blue](https://www.amazon.com/Red-White-Royal-Blue-Novel-ebook/dp/B07J4LPZRN/ref=sr_1_1?crid=ATEWWYWUGVD7&dchild=1&keywords=red+white+and+royal+blue&qid=1599957106&sprefix=red+white+and+%2Caps%2C171&sr=8-1) - This one was such a good book. It was a really great LGBTQ book with a fun story and lovable characters. I was so happy to read something that was inclusive and represented more than the typical couple.
- [Happiness for Beginners](https://www.amazon.com/Happiness-Beginners-Novel-Katherine-Center-ebook/dp/B00MLM9L6E/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2Z9OSJYOYEN45&dchild=1&keywords=happiness+for+beginners+katherine+center&qid=1599963226&sprefix=happieness+for+%2Caps%2C183&sr=8-1) - I will forever read every book Katherine Center writes. I just love all her book. This was a really cute story about starting over and conquering your fears.
- [The Giver of Stars](https://www.amazon.com/Giver-Stars-Novel-Jojo-Moyes-ebook/dp/B07NKP3JL4/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=the+giver+of+stars&qid=1599957151&sr=8-1) - This book will forever be one of my favorites. It was about a group of women who were traveling librarians. It was a lovely story with a wonderful cast of characters.
- [Such a Fun Age](https://www.amazon.com/Such-Fun-Age-Kiley-Reid-ebook/dp/B07QLJ7VTN/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=such+a+fun+age&qid=1599963296&sr=8-1) - I loved this book and how the author took topics like racial inequality and made it into a fun and meaningful book. 
- [Girling Up](https://www.amazon.com/Girling-Up-Strong-Smart-Spectacular-ebook/dp/B01M18M175/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1599963336&sr=8-1) - Mayim Bialik wrote a wonderful book about what it means to be a girl and to grow up and into a woman. It was the perfect amount of information for younger kids without suugarcoating anything important. And it was a great conversation starter.
- [Things You Save in a Fire](https://www.amazon.com/Things-Save-Fire-Katherine-Center-ebook/dp/B07J4WHC78/ref=sr_1_1?crid=17L0EUMNDJ1W3&dchild=1&keywords=things+you+save+in+a+fire+by+katherine+center&qid=1599963370&sprefix=things+you+save+in+%2Caps%2C192&sr=8-1) - This was a heartwarming book about a femal firefighter. It's not a job many women hold and this story made light of some of the ways women aren't treated equally wrapped into a loveable book.
- [The Lost Husband](https://www.amazon.com/Lost-Husband-Novel-Katherine-Center-ebook/dp/B00A5MRG1E/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=the+lost+husband&qid=1599963579&sr=8-2) - This was another cute and fun story about starting over and finding new love.
- [Pretty Things](https://www.amazon.com/Pretty-Things-Novel-Janelle-Brown-ebook/dp/B07YK1JPVQ/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=pretty+things&qid=1599963701&sr=8-1) - I got this as an *Advanced Reader's Copy* from [Netgalley](http://netgalley.com) and it has been one of my favorites from them. It was suspenseful and new and one of my favorite books this year.
- [Emmy in the Key of Code](https://www.amazon.com/Emmy-Key-Code-Aimee-Lucido-ebook/dp/B07LC94KBK/ref=sr_1_1?crid=YQ6E1EHIMWA&dchild=1&keywords=emmy+in+the+key+of+code&qid=1599963737&sprefix=emmy+in+the%2Caps%2C182&sr=8-1) - This was such a special and unique book. The story was told through actual code and poetic prose. It was beautiful and unique and I can't wait to read it with my middle child one day.
- [I'd Rathe Be Reading](https://www.amazon.com/Id-Rather-Be-Reading-Delights-ebook/dp/B07D6XW2CH/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=id+rather+be+reading&qid=1599963777&sr=8-1) - When I read this book it was the perfect book for me at exactly the right time. It was about understanding that while everyone may read books differently, everyone can have a relatioship with reading and books. I will definitely be reading this one again when I get into a reading rut.
- [Stubborn Archivist](https://www.amazon.com/Stubborn-Archivist-Yara-Rodrigues-Fowler-ebook/dp/B07FPBKZWX/ref=sr_1_1?crid=YBO7KF7AZ1UL&dchild=1&keywords=stubborn+archivist&qid=1599963807&sprefix=stubborn+arch%2Caps%2C193&sr=8-1) - This was another unique and beautiful book. The story was a little hard to follow at times, but it was so lovely and different than books I have read. I would like to read this one again one day, too. 
- [Open Book](https://www.amazon.com/Untitled-Memoir-Lou-Htims-ebook/dp/B07GVJPXV9/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=open+book&qid=1599963852&sr=8-1) - This was a surprising book. I don't usually like autobiographies and definitely not ones by famous people. But this one was really good. Listening to the audiobook made it even better because you could really hear her emotions when she was reading.
- [Love Walked In](https://www.amazon.com/Love-Walked-Marisa-Los-Santos-ebook/dp/B003BM9RAS/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=love+walked+in&qid=1599963866&sr=8-1) - A book club member recommended this years ago and I finally read it. I was so glad I finally added it to my list. What a fun and easy read which was just what I needed at the time.
- [White Fragility](https://www.amazon.com/White-Fragility-People-About-Racism-ebook/dp/B07638ZFN1/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=white+fragility&qid=1599963969&sr=8-2) - This was such a great book for white people to read. It was very helpful to guide understanding in the topics of white privilege and racism. Highly recommend this one.
- [Girls Who Code - Friendship Code](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N0X250X?ref_=dbs_m_mng_rwt_calw_tkin_0&storeType=ebooks) - We do a lot of coding around here and this was a fun story about a group of middle school girls who are in a coding club. I think it's really important to have books like this to help encourage girls to code and make male dominated careers feel more attainable.
- [What You Wish For](https://www.amazon.com/What-You-Wish-Katherine-Center-ebook/dp/B07ZMS36CC/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=what+you+wish+for&qid=1599964017&s=digital-text&sr=1-1) - I had been waiting for this one to come out and it didn't disappoint. I loved the characters in this book and flew through it. I didn't want the story to be over. It was a cute love story that made you want to be friends with the characters. 
- [Library Of Ever](https://www.amazon.com/Library-Ever-Zeno-Alexander-ebook/dp/B07CL27HGD/ref=sr_1_1?crid=20U2TZCGDLU0X&dchild=1&keywords=library+of+ever&qid=1599964033&s=digital-text&sprefix=Library+of+ever%2Cdigital-text%2C180&sr=1-1) - Another kids book that my oldest really loved. A girl enters a secret room in a library and goes on a bunch of fun adventures and becomes a librarian herself. It was fun and whimiscal and we both thought it was funny! We will be reading the sequel soon.

So there you go. More than you expected I am sure. I tend to be a little long winded, especially when it comes to books. 

I love to read no matter what form the book comes in. I love having books on my kindle at all times that I can read whenever. I love having an audiobook going at the same time, too. And sometimes, I even read a physical book as well. What are you currently reading? Anything you want to recommend? Do you read more than one book at the same time?
