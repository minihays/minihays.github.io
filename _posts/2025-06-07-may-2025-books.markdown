Here are the 13 books I read in May. May is Mental Health Awareness month, so I made sure to read a few books about mental health.

I hope you find something that looks interesting to you. Below are a few notes on the books this month.

**Total books for the year: 75**

1. 🎧📖 **Obsessed** by *Allison Britz* - This was so good! A memoir about having OCD. This was fascinating, educational and heartbreaking as well as heartwarming. A wonderful read for mental health awareness month.
2. 🎧 📖 **The Perfect Divorce** by *Jeneva Rose* - This was a fun and twisty read. I sort of felt like one of the items from the twist wasn’t fully explained, but there’s a good chance I just missed it. 🤪 I liked that this continued on from the first book.
3. 🎧📱 **More Or Less Maddy** by *Lisa Genova* - This was about a young woman with bipolar disorder. It was a fast-paced and utterly wonderful read. You felt all the ups and downs and struggles and wins. It was a great representation of what one person could experience since everyone has their own journey.
4. 🎧 **Shatter Me** by *Tahereh Mafi* - This had been on my list for a while. I actually love these covers and thought I’d give them a try. This first one was good. A good layout for the series. I was drawn in to read more. I liked the bit of magic and powers and the strong female character. But it is a YA book so it’s a bit juvenile at times. 
5. 🎧📖 **Say You’ll Remember Me** by *Abby Jimenez* - This might be my favorite Abby Jimenez book so far. I devoured this audiobook and I was so sad when this story was over. The characters were fun, great banter and I laughed out loud many times. I am excited for more books in this series and hope these characters make an appearance!
6. 🎧 **Statistically Speaking** by *Debbie Johnson* - This book was so wonderfully unexpected. I loved the characters (main and secondary) and her faults and how they made her into this beautiful, unique person. I am so glad I stumbled upon this heartwarming book.
7. 🎧 **The Strange Case Of Jane O.** By *Karen Thompson Walker* - Strange, intriguing and thought-provoking, this one had you wondering if you figured things out up until the end. Not a light read, but a good one if you like puzzles and needing to think outside the box for the understanding of a book.
8. 📱 **The Cinnamon Bun Bookstore** by *Laurie Gilmore* - This was book 2 in this series. These are light and quick reads and I’ve come to enjoy this series a lot. I like the characters and I like that they all live in a small town and appear in the upcoming novels. A fun, small-town romance with a bit more spice than the first book.
9. 🎧 **The Bookshop Sisterhood** by *Michelle Lindo-Rice* - I really wanted more bookshop out of this book. In reality, it was a drama about four women and their lives changing (some good, some bad) and was much heavier on the sisterhood part than on the bookshop part.
10. 🎧 **Destroy Me** by *Tahereh Mafi* - This was book 1.5 in the series and I totally could have done without this angst-filled drama from a different character’s view. You get a little bit of the story filled in, but it really didn’t add much for me. The narrator was very whiny. I’m glad this one was short!
11. 🎧📱 **Your Brain’s Not Broken** by *Tamara Rosier, PhD* - Every book on ADHD that I read, I see myself in them. Some of the things discussed are the same, and some are a bit different. Not every aspect relates to me (everyone is different), but reading these makes me feel seen, validated, and NOT broken. It has been nice to read about different ADHD experiences and learn more about it. I’ll definitely loving my neuro-spicy brain more than I used to after learning more about how it works! - I also decided to publicly post about my diagnosis this month for mental health awareness month!
12. 📱 **Sheets** by *Brenna Thummler* - Prepare yourself….this was the first graphic novel I have actually picked up to read for myself. ***(gasp)*** I know! I got this thinking my kids would enjoy it and it turned out they were indifferent, but I LOVED it. Even though this is for YA, this touches on a handful of typically hard topics in such a lovely way. Not sure I can say enough good things about this one! ❤️
13. 📱 **Forget Me Not** by *Ellie Terry* - Another fabulous book for mental health awareness month. This was about a girl with Tourette’s Syndrome and it was wonderful. It was written in verse (you know I love that) and I just love how this story came together, how the characters grew and how you just wanted to hug the FMC at the end!
