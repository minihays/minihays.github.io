Yes, I am fully aware that it is the middle of July and I am just now posting my June books. But better late than never, right?!

These are the 9 books I completed in June. I read the same amount as May, but I feel like it was still a slower month. A couple of the books were ones I finished with the kids and one was a really short audiobook. But nevertheless, here they are.

If you want a little more on my thoughts for each of the books, check out my [bookstagram page - @minihaysreads](http://instagram.com/minihaysreads). 

Here is a link for each of the books and summaries for each. I hope you find something that looks interesting to you. 

1. [Firekeeper's Daughter](https://www.amazon.com/Firekeepers-Daughter-Angeline-Boulley/dp/1250766567/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1626360271&sr=8-1) by Angeline Boulley
>Eighteen-year-old Daunis Fontaine has never quite fit in, both in her hometown and on the nearby Ojibwe reservation. She dreams of a fresh start at college, but when family tragedy strikes, Daunis puts her future on hold to look after her fragile mother. The only bright spot is meeting Jamie, the charming new recruit on her brother Levi’s hockey team.
>
>Yet even as Daunis falls for Jamie, she senses the dashing hockey star is hiding something. Everything comes to light when Daunis witnesses a shocking murder, thrusting her into an FBI investigation of a lethal new drug.
>
>Reluctantly, Daunis agrees to go undercover, drawing on her knowledge of chemistry and Ojibwe traditional medicine to track down the source. But the search for truth is more complicated than Daunis imagined, exposing secrets and old scars. At the same time, she grows concerned with an investigation that seems more focused on punishing the offenders than protecting the victims.
>
>Now, as the deceptions―and deaths―keep growing, Daunis must learn what it means to be a strong Anishinaabe kwe (Ojibwe woman) and how far she’ll go for her community, even if it tears apart the only world she’s ever known.

2. [Before I Saw You](https://www.amazon.com/Before-Saw-You-Emily-Houghton-ebook/dp/B08LDWRWMN/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=before+I+saw+you&qid=1626360347&sr=8-1) by Emily Houghton
>Alice Gunnersley and Alfie Mack sleep just a few feet apart from one another. They talk for hours every day. And they’ve never seen each other face-to-face.
>
>After being in terrible accidents, the two now share the same ward as long-term residents of St. Francis’s Hospital. Although they don’t get off to the best start, the close quarters (and Alfie’s persistence to befriend everyone he meets) brings them closer together. Pretty soon no one can make Alice laugh as hard as Alfie does, and Alfie feels like he’s finally found a true confidante in Alice. Between their late night talks and inside jokes, something more than friendship begins to slowly blossom between them.
>
>But as their conditions improve and the end of their stay draws closer, Alfie and Alice are forced to decide whether it’s worth continuing a relationship with someone who’s seen all of the worst parts of you, but never seen your actual face.
>
>A tender novel of healing and hope, Before I Saw You reminds us that connections can be found even in the most unexpected of places—and that love is almost always blind.

3. [Beach Read](https://www.amazon.com/Beach-Read-Emily-Henry-ebook/dp/B07XNKRV83/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=beach+read&qid=1626360412&sr=8-1) by Emily Henry
>Augustus Everett is an acclaimed author of literary fiction. January Andrews writes bestselling romance. When she pens a happily ever after, he kills off his entire cast.
>
>They’re polar opposites.
>
>In fact, the only thing they have in common is that for the next three months, they're living in neighboring beach houses, broke, and bogged down with writer's block.
>
>Until, one hazy evening, one thing leads to another and they strike a deal designed to force them out of their creative ruts: Augustus will spend the summer writing something happy, and January will pen the next Great American Novel. She’ll take him on field trips worthy of any rom-com montage, and he’ll take her to interview surviving members of a backwoods death cult (obviously). Everyone will finish a book and no one will fall in love. Really.

4. [Vulnerable AF](https://www.amazon.com/Vulnerable-AF-Tarriona-Ball/dp/1524865753/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=Vulnerable+AF&qid=1626360478&sr=8-1) by Tarriona Ball
>The real-life story of a relationship in the author's past told in verse and short prose pieces. Relatable and honest, with Tank's signature mix of whimsy and realness, Vulnerable AF is about the difference between love and infatuation, the danger and confusion of losing yourself in the idea of someone else, and coming out on the other side of heartbreak with your sense of self-worth—and your sense of humor—stronger for it.

5. [The Push](https://www.amazon.com/Push-Novel-Ashley-Audrain-ebook/dp/B087BL9MML/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=the+push&qid=1626360546&sr=8-1) by Ashley Audrain
>Blythe Connor is determined that she will be the warm, comforting mother to her new baby Violet that she herself never had.
>
>But in the thick of motherhood's exhausting early days, Blythe becomes convinced that something is wrong with her daughter—she doesn't behave like most children do.
>
>Or is it all in Blythe's head? Her husband, Fox, says she's imagining things. The more Fox dismisses her fears, the more Blythe begins to question her own sanity, and the more we begin to question what Blythe is telling us about her life as well.
>
>Then their son Sam is born—and with him, Blythe has the blissful connection she'd always imagined with her child. Even Violet seems to love her little brother. But when life as they know it is changed in an instant, the devastating fall-out forces Blythe to face the truth.
>
>The Push is a tour de force you will read in a sitting, an utterly immersive novel that will challenge everything you think you know about motherhood, about what we owe our children, and what it feels like when women are not believed.

6. [Polly Diamond and the Magic Book](https://www.amazon.com/Polly-Diamond-Magic-Book/dp/1452182213/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=polly+diamond&qid=1626360614&sr=8-1) by Alice Kuipers
>When a magic book appears on Polly's doorstep that can make everything she writes happen in real life, she is certain all of her dreams are about to come true. However, Polly soon learns that what you write and what you mean are not always the same thing.

7. [Ellie, Engineer: The Next Level](https://www.amazon.com/Ellie-Engineer-Level-Jackson-Pearce/dp/1547602066/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=ellie+engineer&qid=1626360694&sr=8-3) by Jackson Pearce
>After Ellie's first elevator build goes terribly wrong, her parents decide her "punishment" is to assist an elderly neighbor, Mrs. Curran, around the house. Ellie and her friends Kit and Toby are really only supposed to help with little things, but Ellie can't turn down the opportunity to use her engineering skills here and there where she sees a need--because that's what engineers do! It's no fun, though, when Mrs. Curran always gives Toby the credit for all the ingenious projects, and acts like Kit and Ellie were just helping him. . . . Can Ellie come up with another great build to elevate Mrs. Curran's ideas about this girl engineer?
>
>With Ellie's designs and sketches throughout, and her fun guide to simple machines in the back, the continuation of this delightful series will leave young readers laughing and inspired to create.

8. [Family Trust](https://www.amazon.com/Family-Trust-Novel-Kathy-Wang-ebook/dp/B077M9R84W/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=family+trust&qid=1626360825&sr=8-1) by Kathy Wang
>Meet Stanley Huang: father, husband, ex-husband, man of unpredictable tastes and temper, aficionado of all-inclusive vacations and bargain luxury goods, newly diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. For years, Stanley has claimed that he’s worth a small fortune. But the time is now coming when the details of his estate will finally be revealed, and Stanley’s family is nervous.
>
>For his son Fred, the inheritance Stanley has long alluded to would soothe the pain caused by years of professional disappointment. By now, the Harvard Business School graduate had expected to be a financial tech god – not a minor investor at a middling corporate firm, where he isn’t even allowed to fly business class.
>
>Stanley’s daughter, Kate, is a middle manager with one of Silicon Valley’s most prestigious tech companies. She manages the capricious demands of her world-famous boss and the needs of her two young children all while supporting her would-be entrepreneur husband (just until his startup gets off the ground, which will surely be soon). But lately, Kate has been sensing something amiss; just because you say you have it all, it doesn’t mean that you actually do.   
>
>Stanley’s second wife, Mary Zhu, twenty-eight years his junior, has devoted herself to making her husband comfortable in every way—rubbing his feet, cooking his favorite dishes, massaging his ego.  But lately, her commitment has waned; caring for a dying old man is far more difficult than she expected.
>
>Linda Liang, Stanley’s first wife, knows her ex better than anyone. She worked hard for decades to ensure their financial security, and is determined to see her children get their due. Single for nearly a decade, she might finally be ready for some romantic companionship. But where does a seventy-two year old Chinese woman in California go to find an appropriate boyfriend?
>
>As Stanley’s death approaches, the Huangs are faced with unexpected challenges that upend them and eventually lead them to discover what they most value. A compelling tale of cultural expectations, career ambitions and our relationships with the people who know us best, Family Trust skewers the ambition and desires that drive Silicon Valley and draws a sharply loving portrait of modern American family life.

9. [In Five Years](https://www.amazon.com/Five-Years-Novel-Rebecca-Serle-ebook/dp/B07TFB5VWB/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1626360879&sr=8-1) by Rebecca Serle
>Where do you see yourself in five years?
>
>Dannie Kohan lives her life by the numbers.
>
>She is nothing like her lifelong best friend—the wild, whimsical, believes-in-fate Bella. Her meticulous planning seems to have paid off after she nails the most important job interview of her career and accepts her boyfriend’s marriage proposal in one fell swoop, falling asleep completely content.
>
>But when she awakens, she’s suddenly in a different apartment, with a different ring on her finger, and beside a very different man. Dannie spends one hour exactly five years in the future before she wakes again in her own home on the brink of midnight—but it is one hour she cannot shake. In Five Years is an unforgettable love story, but it is not the one you’re expecting.
