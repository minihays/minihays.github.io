![Black History](/images/BlackHistory_Brand.png)
February is Black History Month. I am hoping to share just a small sampling of book suggestions for you to consider reading this month.

My library system provided a [variety of lists](https://www.hclib.org/about/news/2021/January/black-history-resources) and places to look for some diverse books about Black history, books by Black authors and books featuring Black characters. There is a lot of other very useful information on the previous link, too. I snapped a picture of the display at my library for Black History Month.

Here are a number of books I selected to share. I tried to include a wide variety of books for various age groups and interests. Many of them I have read and some are on my list to read this month.
