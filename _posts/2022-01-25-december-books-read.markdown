These are the 18(!!) books I completed in December. If you want a little more on my thoughts for each of the books, check out my [bookstagram page - @minihaysreads](http://instagram.com/minihaysreads). I think next month/year (which is actually this month because I am still trying to get caught up) I will just post links to each of the books instead of the descriptions for each. Then if there are any you are interested in, you can go and read a blurb about them. 

Here is a link for each of the books and summaries for each. I hope you find something that looks interesting to you. 

1. [Punching The Air](https://www.amazon.com/Punching-Air-Ibi-Zoboi-ebook/dp/B082937YH1/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1K9P4PYXE0TUF&keywords=punching+the+air&qid=1643250203&sprefix=punching+the+air%2Caps%2C219&sr=8-1) by Ibi Zoboi
>*The story that I thought*<br>
>*was my life*<br>
>*didn’t start on the day*<br>
>*I was born*<br>
>
>Amal Shahid has always been an artist and a poet. But even in a diverse art school, because of a biased system he’s seen as disruptive and unmotivated. Then, one fateful night, an altercation in a gentrifying neighborhood escalates into tragedy. “Boys just being boys” turns out to be true only when those boys are white. 
>
>*The story that I think*<br>
>*will be my life*<br>
>*starts today*<br>
>
>Suddenly, at just sixteen years old, Amal is convicted of a crime he didn’t commit and sent to prison. Despair and rage almost sink him until he turns to the refuge of his words, his art. This never should have been his story. But can he change it? 
>
>With spellbinding lyricism, award-winning author Ibi Zoboi and prison reform activist Yusef Salaam tell a moving and deeply profound story about how one boy is able to maintain his humanity and fight for the truth in a system designed to strip him of both.

2. [Beautiful Country](https://www.amazon.com/Beautiful-Country-Qian-Julie-Wang-ebook/dp/B08R5FHKHM/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3MS4A0OGFKNI2&keywords=beautiful+country&qid=1643250629&sprefix=beautiful+count%2Caps%2C269&sr=8-1) by Qian Julie Wang
>In Chinese, the word for America, Mei Guo, translates directly to “beautiful country.” Yet when seven-year-old Qian arrives in New York City in 1994 full of curiosity, she is overwhelmed by crushing fear and scarcity. In China, Qian’s parents were professors; in America, her family is “illegal” and it will require all the determination and small joys they can muster to survive.
>
>In Chinatown, Qian’s parents labor in sweatshops. Instead of laughing at her jokes, they fight constantly, taking out the stress of their new life on one another. Shunned by her classmates and teachers for her limited English, Qian takes refuge in the library and masters the language through books, coming to think of The Berenstain Bears as her first American friends. And where there is delight to be found, Qian relishes it: her first bite of gloriously greasy pizza, weekly “shopping days,” when Qian finds small treasures in the trash lining Brooklyn’s streets, and a magical Christmas visit to Rockefeller Center—confirmation that the New York City she saw in movies does exist after all.
>
>But then Qian’s headstrong Ma Ma collapses, revealing an illness that she has kept secret for months for fear of the cost and scrutiny of a doctor’s visit. As Ba Ba retreats further inward, Qian has little to hold onto beyond his constant refrain: Whatever happens, say that you were born here, that you’ve always lived here.
>
>Inhabiting her childhood perspective with exquisite lyric clarity and unforgettable charm and strength, Qian Julie Wang has penned an essential American story about a family fracturing under the weight of invisibility, and a girl coming of age in the shadows, who never stops seeking the light.

3. [Ivy Aberdeen's Letter To The World](https://www.amazon.com/Aberdeens-Letter-World-Ashley-Herring-ebook/dp/B073P4QSG2/ref=sr_1_1?crid=12OCVKU1XR0A&keywords=ivy+aberdeen%27s+letter+to+the+world&qid=1643250733&sprefix=IVy+aberdeen%2Caps%2C117&sr=8-1) by Ashley Herring Blake
>When a tornado rips through town, twelve-year-old Ivy Aberdeen's house is destroyed and her family of five is displaced. Ivy feels invisible and ignored in the aftermath of the storm--and what's worse, her notebook filled with secret drawings of girls holding hands has gone missing.
>
>Mysteriously, Ivy's drawings begin to reappear in her locker with notes from someone telling her to open up about her identity. Ivy thinks--and hopes--that this someone might be her classmate, another girl for whom Ivy has begun to develop a crush. Will Ivy find the courage to follow her true feelings?
>
>Ivy Aberdeen's Letter to the World exquisitely enriches the rare category of female middle-grade characters who like girls--and children's literature at large.

4. [The Storyteller](https://www.amazon.com/Storyteller-Tales-Life-Music-ebook/dp/B091Q9VCP4/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2SAFMF0E2MBJT&keywords=the+storyteller&qid=1643253989&sprefix=the+storyteller%2Caps%2C124&sr=8-1) by Dave Grohl
>**So, I've written a book.**
>
>Having entertained the idea for years, and even offered a few questionable opportunities ("It's a piece of cake! Just do 4 hours of interviews, find someone else to write it, put your face on the cover, and voila!") I have decided to write these stories just as I have always done, in my own hand. The joy that I have felt from chronicling these tales is not unlike listening back to a song that I've recorded and can't wait to share with the world, or reading a primitive journal entry from a stained notebook, or even hearing my voice bounce between the Kiss posters on my wall as a child. 
>
>This certainly doesn't mean that I'm quitting my day job, but it does give me a place to shed a little light on what it's like to be a kid from Springfield, Virginia, walking through life while living out the crazy dreams I had as young musician. From hitting the road with Scream at 18 years old, to my time in Nirvana and the Foo Fighters, jamming with Iggy Pop or playing at the Academy Awards or dancing with AC/DC and the Preservation Hall Jazz Band, drumming for Tom Petty or meeting Sir Paul McCartney at Royal Albert Hall, bedtime stories with Joan Jett or a chance meeting with Little Richard, to flying halfway around the world for one epic night with my daughters…the list goes on. I look forward to focusing the lens through which I see these memories a little sharper for you with much excitement. 

5. [Live Your Life: My Story Of Loving And Losing Nick Cordero](https://www.amazon.com/Live-Your-Life-Loving-Cordero-ebook/dp/B08KQBH5JV/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1MYMP2NPXHOSZ&keywords=live+your+life&qid=1643254062&sprefix=live+your+life%2Caps%2C110&sr=8-1) by Amanda Kloots with Anna Kloots
>**Amanda Kloots bravely reflects on love, loss, and life with her husband, Broadway star, and Tony Award nominee Nick Cordero, whose public battle with COVID-19 and tragic death made headlines around the world.**
>
>In March 2020, Broadway star and Tony Award nominee Nick Cordero was hospitalized for what he and his wife, Amanda Kloots, believed to be a severe case of pneumonia. Entering the hospital, they had every reason to believe that Nick—a young father and otherwise healthy man—would return home. After an eventual diagnosis of COVID-19 that led to Nick’s being placed on a ventilator, Amanda took to documenting their journey on social media, showing the dangers COVID-19 posed to everyone, regardless of age. Her updates quickly captivated millions, inspiring people around the globe to dance each day to Nick’s song “Live Your Life” and offer positive thoughts and prayer. When he passed away after ninety-five grueling days in the ICU, the world grieved for Amanda, her infant son, Elvis, and the future COVID-19 had snatched away from them.
>
>Live Your Life is the story of Nick and Amanda’s life together—of their beautiful relationship, of Nick’s dramatic fight for survival, of those sudden tragic months that permanently changed her world and ours—and of their interrupted future as a family. From the confusing early days of his illness to searching for signs of hope in every update from the doctors to the healing sound of Elvis’s laughter, Amanda details how she approached even the most devastating moments with the personal optimism and faith that have shaped her life. Written with her sister Anna Kloots, who was with her every step of this journey, Live Your Life explores how Amanda’s willingness to accept help from an entire community of people—friends, family, and even total strangers—played a vital role in enduring this hardship. In the process, she offers a touching meditation on how even the worst times have silver linings that deepen our connections to the world around us and to the people who matter most.
>
>What emerges is an inspiring and unexpectedly uplifting message for life in the time of COVID, a vision of courage for anyone coping with overwhelming loss or the collective trauma of what the pandemic has taken from us. A poignant reflection on love, hope, motherhood, and the transformational power of music, Live Your Life is a love letter to Nick and a reminder that, sometimes, celebrating life today is the only path through tomorrow’s darkness.
