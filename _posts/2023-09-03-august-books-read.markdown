Here are the 15 books I read in August. I read some really good books this month and had quite a few I really enjoyed. 

Total books for the year: 109

If you want a little more on my thoughts for each of the books, check out my [bookstagram page - @minihaysreads](http://instagram.com/minihaysreads).
