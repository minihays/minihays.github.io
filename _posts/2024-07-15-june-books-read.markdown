Here are the 8 books I read in June. A few notes on the books this month:

**Family Family** was a lovely book about adoption and family dynamics and making your own choices for you and your family. It was wonderful! I REALLY wanted to love **The Lost Library**. I read it with my youngest and I don't feel like he was very into it. I think there were a few confusing story lines in there that I had to explain to him. They were a little obscure for kids to pick up. It was good, but not a favorite. **The Summer Book Club** had me excited in the beginning, but ended up just OK by the end. There wasn't enough book/book club chat for the title. A friend of mine had me read **The Book Of Doors** because she loved it. I enjoyed it, but just wasn't overly connected to it. it really felt familiar or that I had read something very similar to it before. I have really enjoyed many books by Steven Rowley, but just didn't love **The Guncle Abroad** or the first in the series. Again, not bad, I enjoyed it, but felt like I could only vaguely listen and still follow along fairly easily. Just didn't keep my interest. I saw **My Name Is Memory** come up on a Facebook group and someone was trying to figure out the name of the book. it sounded interesting, so I put it on my list. The book was good, but I thought the ending fell short for me. **Extra Focus** was recommended to me and I felt like I could have highlighted the entire book. And finally, **Mixed Feelings** was a beautiful collection of poetry and art and photos by various ethnic artists and it was just lovely so well done. I quickly added this to my permanent collection.
