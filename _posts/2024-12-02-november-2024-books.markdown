Here are the 13 books I read in November. I won't get to the 151 books I read last year, but I am happy with my progress so far.

Check out my [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/48253141) page for ⭐️ ratings of these books. I started trying out [Fable](https://fable.co/minihays-147798854824) recently. I hope you find something that looks interesting to you. Below are a few notes on the books this month.

**Total books for the year: 113**

1. 🎧 **Once There Were Wolves** by *Charlotte McConaghy* - This book was interesting. I thought it was a very unique book, but I didn't connect to it like I hoped I would. I actually think that was because of a few things I read about the book after I finished. SOme speculations people made. I didn't see it that way and then I had to rethink the book a bit.
2. 🎧📖📱 **Ask For Andrea** by *Noelle West Ihli* - I have had this one on my to-read list for so long. I am so glad I finally read this one. I loved it so much. The main characters had very unique perspectives.
3. 🎧📱 **After Annie** by *Anna Quindlen* - I thought this one was ok. I didn't find anything life changing about it, but it was an endearing read about grief and loss.
4. 🎧📱 **Sandwich** by *Catherine Newman* - This one seemed to be everywhere recently. I felt like it was more of a journal entry/memory told as a book. It felt so realistic and was just a nice, easy read.
5. 🎧📱 **The Life Impossible** by *Matt Haig* - A magical book, with some fairly impossible instances. There were parts I really liked, but also found myself a little bored at other times. Not quite as good as I was hoping, but good overall.
6. 🎧 **Last Call At The Local** by *Sarah Grunder Ruiz* - I loved this one. It had neuro-divergent characters who were so honest and lovable. It was a joy to read.
7. 🎧📱 **Love At First Book** by *Jenn McKinlay* - A sweet, bookish romance with witty characters, unlikely friendships and just an overall lovely book.
8. 🎧 **The Lost Story** by *Meg Shaffer* - I think I would have enjoyed this book more if I had known a bit more about it going into it. I was expecting something different and therefore didn't connect to it very much. It felt a bit like "The Lion, The Witch, & The Wardrobe".
9. 📱 **Pumpkin Spice And Everything Nice** by *Katie Cicatelli-Kuc* - This was a really cute book. BUT it is displayed on the same shelf as very spicy books at stores and this is NOT spicy. This is also sold by [Scholastic Books](https://clubs.scholastic.com/pumpkin-spice-and-everything-nice/9781339030753-rco-us.html#q=pumpkin%2Bspice&start=1). It's a cute book, but also very innocent. I think there was some hand-holding. So might be a good book for younger readers to get into romance books if they are interested.
10. 🎧 **Daydream** by *Hannah Grace* - Now this one was spicier. This is book 3 of the Icebreaker books and I think I liked this one the best. There were neuro-divergent characters, lots of good communication and an overall really good book. 
11. 🎧📱 **The Last One At The Wedding** by *Jason Rekulak* - Meh. I really liked his other book "Hidden Pictures", but this one didn't do much for me. I kept hoping for a really great twist and it just didn't do it for me at all.
12. 📖👩‍👧‍👦 **Belly Up** by *Stuart Gibbs* - I read this with my youngest. He wasn't really into it at the beginning, but as we got farther into the book, he was more invested. By the end, he was begging to read and finish it with me. This is book 1 in a big series if your kids enjoy it.
13. 🎧📱 **Daring Greatly** by *Brene Brown* - This was recommended to me. I found parts of it very fitting and relatable. Other parts didn't fit my needs. I think this was my first Brene Brown book and I will be reading others.
