Yesterday, while talking with a friend, we decided to start a [yoga challenge](https://yogawithadriene.com/breath-a-30-day-yoga-journey/) together. We called in another yoga friend and started a little group.

I woke up early, without my alarm and headed to my mat. It was glorious. I knew I needed some stretching and my body was tight, but I didn’t realize just how wonderful it would be.

There is a poem on the yoga challenge I wanted to share.

<center>A whisper</center>
<center>A wave</center>
<center>A friend</center>
<center>A vehicle</center>
<center>A birthright</center>
<center>An opportunity</center>
<center>To grow</center>
<center>Stronger</center>
<center>Softer</center>
<center>Closer</center>
<center>To ourselves</center>
<center>And one another</center>

Tomorrow I’m going to move my mat upstairs (the basement was too cold) and I found I loved doing the exercise with headphones. It helped me to focus and drown out the sounds of the house. I love doing yoga in the morning because its dark and quiet and peaceful.

I realize we didn’t start on January 1st. And that’s ok. We started. And I’m so happy to have a couple friends to do this with to keep me focused and on track! I created a little yoga workout tracker for us to track our progress and help keep us accountable.
