Here are the 9 books I read in October. Aside from the first book of the month that was a poetry book, the rest of the month was filled with YA and middle grade books. That was about all the mental capacity I had this month. 

Total books for the year: 131

If you want a little more on my thoughts for each of the books, check out my [bookstagram page - @minihaysreads](http://instagram.com/minihaysreads). 

Here is a link for each of the books, in the order I read them. I hope you find something that looks interesting to you.
