Here are the 13 books I read in May. I'm really having fun making these pretty matching backgrounds for the books. I also love the way they look as a little collage.

If you want a little more on my thoughts for each of the books, check out my [bookstagram page - @minihaysreads](http://instagram.com/minihaysreads). 

Here is a link for each of the books. I hope you find something that looks interesting to you.
