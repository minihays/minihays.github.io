Here are the 17 books I read in October. I read about so many witches and enjoyed a variety of creepy books! I will also say that I don't always write a blurb about the book right away. Part of what takes me so long to get these done, is trying to remember WTF the book was about because as soon as I finish a book....*POOF* it is gone from my brain!

I hope you find something that looks interesting to you. Below are a few notes on the books this month.

**Total books for the year: 149**

1. 🎧 **Unworld** by *Jayson Greene* - This one had an interesting premise and a focus on AI. It was a good read, but not one of my favorites. It talked about grief, loss, technology and AI and how they impact the human connection.
2. 🎧 **So Many Stars** by *Caro De Robertis* - This was a fascitinating read done in a very unique format. Each chapter focuses on a topic and then various people tell snippets or a story about their experience. Very lovely book.
3. 🎧 **Dream Count** by *Chimamanda Ngozi Adichi* - 
4. 🎧 **Otherworld** by *Jason Segel & Kirsten Miller* - I came across this one when I was looking for other books by Kirsten Miller for an upcoming book signing I was going to for her newest book. This was a fun book she wrote with Segel many years ago. I listened to the audiobook and he narrated it. The book was a fun YA sci-fi read about virtual reality becoming a bit too real. I am definitely going to read the rest of the series and I was able to get these signed by her. There is also another series by them that I'll be looking into as well.
5. 🎧 **Hot For Slayer** by *Ali Hazelwood*
6. 🎧 **Falling** by *Christina Lauren* 
7. 🎧 **Spicy Little Curses** by *J.T. Geissinger* 
8. 🎧 **Space Vampire** by *Ruby Dixon* 
9. 🎧 **Beautiful Nightmare** by *Katee Robert* 
10. 🎧 **My Boyfriends Are All Monsters** by *Kimberly Lemming* <br />
-- Books 5-10 were short stories from [Amazon Original Stories: Scared Sexy](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FLJHDGY1?binding=kindle_edition&ref=dbs_dp_rwt_sb_pc_tkin). I enjoyed "Hot For Slayer" and "Falling" and then the rest were increasingly less favorable. They were silly, short stories, so I don't feel like I'm out much, but I'm not surprised I liked the books from authors I also consistently enjoy.
11. 🎧 **These Witches Don’t Burn** by *Isabel Sterling* - This was the October book pick for [The Beacon Book Club](/beaconbookclub/booksread). I was a little hesitant to do another YA book, but it seemed fitting for October. The book started out very slow and I was worried about what we had gotten ourselves into. But it started to really pick up about half way through and got more exciting as the book went on. I ended up really enjoying this one....see next book. 
12. 🎧 **This Coven Won’t Break** by *Isabel Sterling* - This was book two in the series. I figured I could get this one done while I was working on projects. It was the same slow start to the book and again, did pick up in the second half. I didn't like this one as much as the first book, but also felt like I needed to finish the series....see next book.
13. 📱 **This Spell Can’t Cast** by *Isabel Sterling* - This was the prequel to the series, book 0.5. This events in this one had been referenced a number of times in books 1 and 2. I feel like we probably didn't need a short story for this one, but I read it anyway. Didn't add a ton to the other stories, though. Now see the next book. 
14. 📱 **These Charms Won’t Fade** by *Isabel Sterling* - And finally, this was book 2.5 in the series and takes place 7 years after book 2. I thought it was a really great ending to the characters, especially after the way book 2 ended. I'm glad I finished the series, but reading them all wouldn't be necessary. You could read the first one and be just fine. 
15. 📱 **Dragon Fires Everywhere** by *Hazel Beck* - I had been waiting for this one to come out and I was not disappointed! I found the first book in this series by chance and loved it so much. I then devoured the current three books in the series. This final book was such a perfect ending to this series and I really loved everything about the book and collection as well as all of the characters. I loved the stories from this dynamic duo of authors and I can't wait for more by them!
16. 🎧 **The Most Unusual Haunting Of Edgar Lovejoy** by *Roan Parrish* - I was really excited about this LGBTQIA+ book. And I really liked it overall. My one note is that the sex scenes were more detailed than I was expecting. It didn't necessarily harm the book, but also maybe wasn't necessary to enhance the story.
17. 🎧 **Never Whistle At Night** by *Shane Hawk, Theodore C. Van Alst Jr. & others* - I started this a long time ago. I am obsessed with how gorgeous this cover is! With all short story collections, I enjoyed some more than others. But it is always fascinating to read stories from a variety of authors. The dark undertones of all the stories, definitely made this a creepy book and a lovely tribute to indigenous history.
