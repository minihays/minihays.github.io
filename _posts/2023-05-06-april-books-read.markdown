Here are the 18 books I read in April. There were, again, a handful that were by repeat authors. Sometimes I find someone I enjoy and then try to read more of their books if they are available.

If you want a little more on my thoughts for each of the books, check out my [bookstagram page - @minihaysreads](http://instagram.com/minihaysreads). 

Here is a link for each of the books. I hope you find something that looks interesting to you.
