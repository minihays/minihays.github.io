February is Black History Month. I am hoping to share just a small sampling of book suggestions for you to consider reading this month.

My library system provided a [variety of lists](https://www.hclib.org/about/news/2021/January/black-history-resources) and places to look for some diverse books about Black history, books by black authors and books featuring black characters. There is a lot of other very useful information on the previous link, too.
